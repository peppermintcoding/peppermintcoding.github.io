            <p>Chapter 8
<br>
<br>
<br>"This is unacceptable", his ugly voice thunders through the room. "What kind of establishment are 
<br>you running here anyway? This is not what I paid a little fortune for."
<br>"What seems to be the problem here?" Sakara asked condescendingly calm. She was sitting behind 
<br>her big mahogany desk with countless trinkets cluttering it from left to right. One of the trinkets was
<br>quite special, a little hand mirror. It was decorated with a seamless rim made from different charged 
<br>sapphires. The stones were cut so perfectly, every single one of them fit flawlessly with the two 
<br>adjacent neighbors. It had the advantage of having a built in light source for when you have to 
<br>check your make up and appearance, which was constantly with Sakara.
<br>"The problem?" he exclaimed furious. "She is the fucking problem", pointing towards Clair. She 
<br>was standing a little behind and to the left of the angry man. He hadn't even given her the time to 
<br>put back on her clothes and had dragged her by the hair through the whole brothel to Sakara's 
<br>office. She just managed to roll a bed sheet around her chest and waist so she wasn't exposed 
<br>completely. "If I want boring sex with a woman, who stays quiet and motionless I stay at home and 
<br>fuck my wife. I came here to see what special experiences you have to offer. I have to say, you got 
<br>quite the interesting reputation here, Sakara. But her? How can you expect a customer to want her? 
<br>It's like having sex with a fucking stone cold statue. She doesn't even flinch when I slap her across 
<br>the face."
<br>Sakara raised an eyebrow and put down her fabled mirror, she had been checking her eyebrows in. 
<br>"She doesn't flinch, hm?" Sakara stood up from her chair and walked around the table to see face to 
<br>face with hairy chest. "Is that right, Clair? He hit you?"
<br>"Yes", she answered looking her straight in the eye. If Sakara noticed her anger and disgust, she was
<br>hiding it well.
<br>"So, she says you hit her. If you are not satisfied with the effect, then maybe hit harder?"
<br>Hairy chest looked at Sakara flabbergasted. "And now you are trying to insult me as well as 
<br>providing horrible services? I hit her, and I hit her hard. Do you want to tell me I am a weakling?"
<br>"Clair, did he hit you hard?"
<br>Clair bit her lips.
<br>"Answer me. Now."
<br>Don't say it Clair, she thought. But to be honest, this couldn't get any worse anyway. So why try to 
<br>conceal something if unnecessary. "He hits like a child."
<br>The slap hit her a little delayed, but she expected it. He was a insecure, hairy, ugly, little man. A girl 
<br>insulting his manliness and strength would get his blood boiling in no time. The impact sent Clair 
<br>down to one knee and she spat out some blood. Apparently, she accidentally bit her tongue.
<br>"I understand where the problem lies now", Sakara intervened. "I have to apologize, this was all just
<br>a big misunderstanding. You see, she is quite the unique little girl, there must have been a mix up 
<br>somewhere. You will of course be refunded if you like or can take another girl from the lobby."
<br>"Any girl?" he asked a little appeased.
<br>"Of course. My reputation says, no man or woman will leave this house unsatisfied. And I will see 
<br>to it, personally if necessary." As if, Clair thought. Sakara clapped twice with her hands and Deko 
<br>appeared from outside the office. He was smoking a cigar butt. "Deko, please escort the gentleman 
<br>down to the lobby and let him pick a girl of his choosing. Also, get a new room ready for him, we 
<br>want him as comfortable as humanly possible." Deko nodded.
<br>Before hairy ass went out the door, he turned around one last time. "I hope the next girl has more 
<br>fire than this one. My grandma is a better fuck than her." Clair wanted to spit in his face, but that 
<br>would probably be going to far. She didn't know Sakara for long, but she already got, that you don't 
<br>want to overstep your boundaries with her.
<br>Sakara examined Clair with narrow eyes. "Please go and wash yourself, put on some clothes and get
<br>back here as soon as you are done with it. I need to talk to you."
<br>Clair nodded and fled the office. She closed the door behind her and passed Deko leaning on the 
<br>wall. The smoke of his cigar hurting her eyes. She made a left turn down the corridor. Sakara's 
<br>office was in the middle of the building overlooking the lobby. The lobby was where the girl hung 
<br>out before a customer came to bring them up to a room. It was where everything was still alright. 
<br>People had the option to gamble and drink in company of some beautiful girls. Clair would sit on 
<br>the lap of someone for hours sometimes, refilling their drink or bringing them something to eat, 
<br>letting them play a little bit with her and laughing at some stupid jokes. Sadly, it was seldom enough
<br>for the men coming here. They all wanted to go upstairs.
<br>All around the lobby one story higher, were the suites. Every single one was furnished with a round 
<br>bed, one of Sakara's specials distinguishing her from other similar establishments, and a couple of 
<br>different options, like chairs or for the better paying customers a bathtub big enough for one and a 
<br>half people.
<br>Another story upstairs, right underneath the roof, were the rooms for the staff, mostly for the girls. 
<br>The other staff didn't live like slaves in the brothel, but then again, slavery was outlawed and there 
<br>were no slaves anymore. Technically at least. Sakara had her ways to make everyone act according 
<br>to her plans, without much chance of opposition. The stairway creaked when she walked up the last 
<br>step. Up here the air was a lot stuffier and hotter than below, but it was more quiet. The live music 
<br>from below was a mere faint noise in the background, but the moaning from the suites was kind of 
<br>annoying. She still hadn't gotten used to it. Clair's room was in one of the back corners of the 
<br>building.
<br>A door opened and Oria almost collided with Clair. "I am so sorry, Clair", she apologized.
<br>"No problem. Are you feeling a bit better?"
<br>"Sakara has luckily given me another day to recover. No use meeting customers if you can't breathe 
<br>through your nose and you look like a corpse, is it?"
<br>"How very nice of her." Oria was one of the older girls of Sakara. She was quite tall and from the 
<br>North of the nation. She had auburn hair, which was mostly braided with traditional northern 
<br>patterns. Being a part of this business she had some perks, that none other had. For example she was
<br>permitted to have a pet in her room, a talking raven from the North. It mostly knew swear words 
<br>and was dauntingly good at imitating the moans of men, but what else could you expect from 
<br>growing up in a brothel.
<br>"Are you already off for today?" she asked with raised eyebrows.
<br>"As if Sakara would ever allow something like this. On the contrary actually, I had some problems 
<br>with this customer and now she wants to talk with me in her office after I cleaned myself up."
<br>Her expression changed immediately into something more supportive. "If it's bad you tell me 
<br>alright? I think I still got some ointments left from my regular. But now carry on and hurry, making 
<br>her wait will make it only worse."
<br>Clair nodded, said goodbye and went into her room. San was still in the kitchen helping out as well 
<br>as he could, but it wasn't going great. He was too young to work in a big kitchen like this one. He 
<br>was mostly in the way or too slow and clumsy to be of much use. They were given one bed to sleep 
<br>in, but it was indeed a comfortable one, without any bugs or flees. Hygiene was one of the most 
<br>important things for Sakara. Clair threw the bed sheet on the dirty laundry pile and went to their 
<br>little bath tub, made from wood. It was barely enough to sit inside, even for Clair who wasn't very 
<br>tall. The water was provided by fancy tubes running from a cistern on the roof of the brothel. For 
<br>the guests there was also warm water, but in their room only cold water was available. Mandatory 
<br>baths in the basement were held every other day though to oversee perfect hygiene. She picked out 
<br>a lavender smelling soap and started brushing off the dirt on her body. It wasn't really visible, but 
<br>she could feel it rather than see it. She remembered the first few weeks after she arrived, she had 
<br>cried every time in this bathtub. She had adopted rather quickly, she had to. San's future depended 
<br>on it.
<br>#
<br>Freshly washed and smelling like lavender, Clair put on some normal clothes to see Sakara again. 
<br>Normal here meant she had to wear a light blue dress, tied together tightly at the waist with a deep 
<br>blue band. It was horribly ugly to Clair, but what was she to do. It was suppose to be part of the 
<br>overall atmosphere in the brothel, or whatever. She hadn't washed her hair, because she thought it 
<br>would take to long and wasn't that important. She had bound them into a nice pony tail.
<br>Walking down the stairs again, the music and moaning picked up, but also the shouts from the 
<br>gambling below. Probably another one thinking he was being duped by Sakara. They actually were, 
<br>but where were you not? Deko was still leaning outside the office against the wall, but luckily his 
<br>cigar had vanished. It wouldn't be long until he longed for another one. He barely gave her any 
<br>thought. Clair breathed in deep and entered into Sakara's office.
<br>Sakara wasn't sitting behind her desk or waiting impatiently for her arrival, instead, to Clair's 
<br>surprise, she was standing at the wood stove by one of the windows boiling some water in a tea pot. 
<br>The fire crackled audibly and big sapphire chandelier was fighting off the shadows of the night. The
<br>light was always changing though, giving the shadows it created a life of their own. "Please take a 
<br>seat", Sakara said oddly soft. She was trying to get something particular. No way she would act this 
<br>calm under normal circumstances if a customer had complained like hairy chest had before. 
<br>Something was going on. Clair walked over to the empty chair with weak legs. There wasn't much 
<br>Sakara could actually do to her, that she feared, but this woman always found the one thing to 
<br>ensure she was in control.
<br>"Do you like some tea?" she asked walking over with the boiling tea pot. White steam pouring out 
<br>from the top of it. She poured the water slowly over some tea leaves. She did it with so much care, 
<br>it was like Clair was watching a completely different person. So much attention to detail, she was 
<br>circling over the leaves in even circles, only letting a slow stream of water run over the tea. It 
<br>immediately smelled of black tea and some spice Clair hasn't smelled in forever.
<br>"Is this Karucha tea?" she asked irritated.
<br>"A good nose you have", Sakara answered and put a cup in front of Clair without asking again. "I 
<br>thought you might like this tea. I have bought a whole crate of this tea last week, you are welcome 
<br>to have some of it for you personally. It must be nice to be reminded of your country."
<br>"I was born in Shima." Clair looked at the cup of delicious tea. She wanted to grab it and take a sip, 
<br>but immediately stopped herself. Remember the rules, she told herself. Only drink when someone 
<br>else has already drunk from it without burning their tongue.
<br>"Is that so? I didn't even know. Well, that's why we are here right now, to get to know each other a 
<br>bit better, aren't we? Tell me a little bit about yourself? There aren't many Maru people in Shima, 
<br>are both your parents Maru?"
<br>What was she getting at? It's probably best to simply see where this was going and play the game. 
<br>"My mother was Maru, but she died when I was quite young. My father is from Shima, so I am only
<br>half Maru."
<br>"How did they meet then? It's not like there is much interaction anymore between the continents 
<br>besides trade of course. I suppose it makes sense, but it is a shame in my opinion."
<br>"My father was a sailor on a trade ship, the Flying Rabbit as they called it."
<br>"The Flying Rabbit?" Sakara laughed, a beautiful, silvery laugh. "Why was that? I am curious now."
<br>"It wasn't its name from the beginning, though I don't remember what it was before. Anyway", 
<br>Sakara poured in some tea into Clair's mug, "my father often told me the story, but I am not so sure 
<br>if it's actually quite accurate. But one day, they were getting attacked by seven pirate ships at once. 
<br>From all angles they were closing in and the crew thought they were doomed beyond any hope. The
<br>captain though, ordered them to try at least and navigated them through all of the attacks, dodging 
<br>away barely escaping the fleet of pirates with the whole crew alive and the ship intact. They said it 
<br>was like the ship was a rabbit running circles around the slow pirates. I never gave much to the 
<br>story, but my father loved to tell it."
<br>"Honey?" Sakara asked and Clair nodded. She pulled out a small jar with a golden lid, what was 
<br>this? The special honey, too? "I always loved stories like that. Even if they might be exaggerations, 
<br>everybody loves a good story with people winning against the odds. Maybe he should have put in a 
<br>kraken to the story as well, but that might be too much again. Well, it doesn't matter does it?"
<br>Clair didn't know how to answer, so she stirred in her tea for the honey to dissolve. It smelled 
<br>delicious, with little swirls of steam rising to the ceiling.
<br>"And where are your parents now?" Sakara asked again after a little pause. She apparently had 
<br>expected Clair to say something, a pause like this wasn't like her at all.
<br>"Sakara", Clair began and had to clear her throat before going on, "I appreciate your questions and 
<br>the tea and all and I don't want to seem disrespectful, but this feels totally weird to me. I am sitting 
<br>here waiting for the thing you actually want to say to me. I know you are angry because of before 
<br>and I apologize deeply for it, it was simply too much. It won't-"
<br>"Let me stop you right there. I am not angry in the slightest and you don't have to try and make up 
<br>things now to soothe my non existing anger."
<br>"Not angry?" Clair asked irritated.
<br>"On the contrary, my dear." There was her smile again. A smile that sends cold shivers down your 
<br>spine instead of making you feel welcome. "But I want you to answer me one last question before I 
<br>will tell you my reasons. And I want a clear and honest answer from you, is that clear?" Clair 
<br>nodded, not daring to move any more. "Is it true, that you can't feel any physical pain at all?"
<br>Clair froze in her seat completely. But she should have seen this coming. Sakara was quite attentive 
<br>when it came to her girls, nothing went passed her. Clair's mother has always warned her about 
<br>talking about it. Nobody knew outside her family and nobody needed to know. It wasn't natural, 
<br>some would even say it was a curse by the Gods. "Yes", she whispered.
<br>"There is no need to be coy about it, my dear. This is exciting news to be honest and not something 
<br>to be ashamed about. It is part of who you are and you definitely don't need to hide it in my house. I
<br>would even go so far as to say this will make things a lot better for you, well for the both of us."
<br>"But you can't tell anybody. People will think I am a cursed child, it has to be kept a secret. I will 
<br>pay more attention the next time. I am quite good at pretending to hurt when someone hits me, it's 
<br>not that hard."
<br>"And I don't want you to do anything different really. We might need to work on your performance 
<br>a bit from now on, that I know of your precious little secret. Don't worry, darling, it will be safe 
<br>with me. Stop looking so sad", she took a sip from the tea, "ah so delicious. Did you know I started 
<br>at a similar position as you are in right now. I was a street kid just like you, been taken in by a 
<br>woman just like me. Eventually I learned from her and took over the business once she was no 
<br>longer running things correctly. And do you know why I overtook her business?"
<br>Clair shook her head. "Because I am a visionary. I see talents in people, everybody else think are 
<br>not more than useless scum. Now I have eyes and ears everywhere, always on the look out for new 
<br>prospects and you were one of them. I noticed it from the start, that you are special Clair. Don't you 
<br>see, this is no curse, it is a gift. And we will use this gift to great effect. You are truly special, 
<br>something people are seeking their whole life for."
<br>"Why would they seek for someone like me?" 
<br>"You will see soon enough. I will give you the day off, tomorrow you will meet a special customer, 
<br>he will explain everything to you then." She leaned her head over to the side. "Drink up, my dear." 
<br>That wicked smile.
<br>Clair took a sip of the black tea, savoring the aroma she hadn't smelled or tasted in years. It was 
<br>weird drinking it without her mother sitting across from her. She would never have dreamed to be in
<br>this situation.
<br>"Why do you look so troubled?" Sakara asked. "These are splendid changes coming to you and to 
<br>all the other girls really. You will see how they are going to appreciate your newly found talents."
<br>Clair kept looking into the black liquid in her mug. The warmth was radiating through the mug, but 
<br>she didn't feel it really. Heat was something she wasn't able to distinguish really. Was something too
<br>hot, was it too cold? She never knew and was always dependent on others. It was especially hard in 
<br>her child hood trying to understand the world. Her parents basically never left her sight. Clair would
<br>sit too close to the fire and didn't notice until some of her skin would turn red from early burns. She 
<br>has multiple scars from all sorts of things, some funny some not.
<br>"I think I have something to cheer you up, my dear", Sakara said to disperse the silence.
<br>"Why do you want to cheer me up in the first place though?" she asked instead.
<br>Sakara raised an eyebrow, "Why wouldn't I, my child? I care for you of course, and I want you to 
<br>feel your best."
<br>"I guess nobody wants to fuck a sad girl, do they?"
<br>"You are quite smart and direct, Clair. I like that, but I also think it's dangerous in certain situations. 
<br>I tolerated your behavior with the customer before, because I understand the real value and 
<br>reasoning behind it all. But don't forget who you are and what your job here is. The coming 
<br>clientele won't be as forgiving anymore. It's a well meant warning, nothing to make you scared."
<br>Clair took another sip, looking down.
<br>"Now", Sakara put down her mug onto the table and refilled it from the teapot. The black liquid 
<br>swirling with steam. "Let's talk about your little brother." Instantly all of Clair's hair started to stand 
<br>up. She looked up from her own mug and focused on Sakara. "It's nice to have your undivided 
<br>attention", she said dryly.
<br>"What about my brother?"
<br>"Don't worry I only have good things in mind for him. Great things, actually."
<br>"Sakara", Clair jumped up from her chair clutching the mug, "you can't be serious. He is just a child
<br>for Gods sake."
<br>She waited patiently with an emotionless face until Clair had sat down again before continuing to 
<br>speak. "Do you really think so ill of me? This is a pleasure house of women and nothing else. You 
<br>don't mix, it's bad for business. Even though he would be quite the looker with these striking blue 
<br>eyes. I haven't seen a boy as beautiful as your little brother in for ever. But no, that's not what I had 
<br>in mind. We both know he it isn't working out in the kitchen, he is annoying my staff more than he 
<br>is helping, which is understandable for his age and he has no experience at working in a kitchen at 
<br>all. He might be worth something in a year or two, but for now he is only costing me money."
<br>"But I am making the money, it should be enough for the both of us."
<br>"Let me speak, child. I am willing to invest some money into this boy, after all you are going to 
<br>make us quite the fortune if everything goes well. It's also undeniable you are quick on your feet 
<br>and I hope to believe your brother has inherited the same characteristics as you. I am willing to roll 
<br>the dice on it for now."
<br>"What are you talking about?" Clair was feeling sick to the stomach. At least she didn't want him 
<br>working on the floor like she had to, that was a little relieve, but something felt wrong.
<br>"Do you know what's the biggest bottleneck for my business here? What do you think is the task I 
<br>can't seem to find good people for?"
<br>"I don't know. Girls immune to physical pain, maybe?"
<br>"Funny, but no. Girls are never hard to get. If one is getting too old, too ill or whatever there is 
<br>always someone waiting to fill the place. Some come even voluntarily to my doorstep trying to find 
<br>work, so in that case you should be thankful for your position."
<br>"I feel so blessed, a lifetime of thanks wouldn't be enough, holy savior."
<br>"Don't over do it", Sakara countered coldy. "No, what is really hard to find are people with an 
<br>education, who can manage numbers, taxes and laws. There are lots of officials to be bribed, money
<br>to be managed and laws to bend. Who is going to do it? At the moment there is only me, but I am 
<br>getting tired of it all. I want to focus on other things and not stick my head into papers and book all 
<br>day long."
<br>"And you want my child brother to do the work for you?" Clair laughed. "I have barely taught him 
<br>to read a simple sentence with his name in it. How is he suppose to do this kind of work."
<br>"Where you see only negatives, I see potential. Trust me, it is a gift of mine. I can see what others 
<br>can't. He can already count, calculate simple things and read a few words. That is more than most of
<br>the people under this roof or in this whole district can do. What do you think he can do after a year 
<br>of a good school education? Of course he won't be only there for school, but will also have to work,
<br>but in a environment better suited for a boy of his age."
<br>An education? In a real school? It could open up a life for him, so much different to her own, but 
<br>Sakara couldn't be serious. There was no way she would just spent that amount of money for 
<br>something like this. "I don't believe you", Clair said. "What is your real end goal here? This can't be
<br>real."
<br>"How insulting for you to have so little trust in me. But it's getting late already. My end goal, as you
<br>put it, is nothing that concerns you. I have told you all I wanted to, and it's nothing less than the 
<br>truth. And frankly, I have no interest in your opinion in this. This is not a negotiation, but I am 
<br>telling you what is going to happen. It's either that or I will sell him to the highest bidder. You aren't 
<br>worth enough for you to act up on me like this. Do you understand?"
<br>Clair nodded.
<br>"He will be going to a school in one of the northern districts, a special holy school run by priests for
<br>special cases like your brother. For children without parents or a family. It will also mean though, 
<br>you can't be visiting him and he won't visit you here. It's simply not feasible."
<br>"But that means he will be at the other side of the city. I won't be able to see him? No, no you can't 
<br>do this. Please, he has nobody besides me."
<br>"He will find friends quickly, don't worry. And because I feel bad about separating you two like this,
<br>I will allow you to send and receive letters from each other. Deko will carry them with him a couple
<br>of times a month, when he is running errands in that part of the city. How does that sound? No trust 
<br>needed, he will be alright and get something most street kids can only dream of. A future."
<br>It was sounding better than living in a brothel. She wanted the best for her brother even if that 
<br>meant letting him go and live at the other end of the city. Writing letters would also ensure Sakara 
<br>wasn't pulling anything weird.
<br>"I guess that's more than fair", she said, but was there really anything different Clair could say?
<br>"Well, then that's settled." Sakara smiled at her, in the weird pulsating light of the sapphire 
<br>chandelier her face looked almost bestial. "Drink up, my dear. We don't want the tea to go cold, do 
<br>we?"<br></p>
