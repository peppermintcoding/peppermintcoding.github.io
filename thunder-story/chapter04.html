            <p>Chapter 3
<br>
<br>
<br>The air was still cold and wet when the Professor was loading up the wagons. In the distance the 
<br>thunderstorm was still raging on sending thunder through his bones, the sun about to crest the 
<br>horizon and paint the world in a warmer color. Lightning lanterns illuminating the caravan and 
<br>street. They would soon have to give up on lightning power when they went over the border. 
<br>Hopefully the few men he paid to follow his instructions of documenting the thunderstorms would 
<br>carry out their task with a certain seriousness, but he doubted it. The sapphire cube around his neck 
<br>was freshly charged with lightning and the current was dancing in seemingly random patterns 
<br>within the gem. It was so mesmerizing that the Professor often spent hours watching it circling 
<br>inside the gem. It always seemed to him, the lightning had a mind of its own. Wanting to escape it's 
<br>blue prison and be reunited with its brethren in nature. When lightning hit the earth it vanished 
<br>instantly without leaving any trace for the most part. It might char some wood or set a tree on fire 
<br>and he even saw it strike sand and turn it into dirty glass. But where would it go after that? 
<br>Somehow it was unthinkable that this pure energy was just vanishing, but when channeled into a 
<br>sapphire it was trapped inside ready for use. So many mysteries they had no answer too and he had 
<br>to go on this useless almost suicidal trip around the grasslands to find something he knew was 
<br>impossible to find out there.
<br>The city felt empty out here by the wall. Down near the harbor the streets were already being 
<br>plucked up by the sheer amount of traders and workers running around. Trade by ship was way 
<br>more lucrative, fast and safe than trading with the tribes of the grassland. So close to the outer wall 
<br>he felt a strong loneliness emanating from the city itself. Looking around at his new companions he 
<br>was even more disappointed, no to put it into the right words, crushed. The Professor knew of the 
<br>importance of every craft and he didn't see his own profession as something higher or more 
<br>important. But he couldn't shake the feeling, he was unwelcome between these men and women. It 
<br>was rather obvious how they eyed him from the side, had to help him with basic tasks like securing 
<br>the cargo onto the wagons or making sure everything was covered by a tarp against the rain. They 
<br>were shipping all sorts of cargo, from crafted tools and jewelry to dried meat, rice or other food, 
<br>which could be conserved for a longer period of time. But these surely wasn't his people. The 
<br>conversation were bland and revolving around their uninteresting work. So little actual planning or 
<br>optimization went into their trips it was almost comical if it wasn't so serious. And if he wasn't a 
<br>part of them now. How for lightning's sake could he survive this for half a year?
<br>It now pained him even more he had to leave Clair behind. He knew it was selfish to think about 
<br>this part of the whole situation, but he couldn't help it. He wasn't sure how she would fair in Shima 
<br>without the income and shelter from him, but he knew she would manage somehow. She was way 
<br>smarter than anyone would guess when they saw her first, especially given her background. What a 
<br>wasted talent, he thought sometime. She could have even surpassed him, if she would have gotten 
<br>the proper education he had gotten when he was a child. He was concerned anyways though. 
<br>Without her comments and talks to keep his mind occupied he felt lonely, like he hadn't felt for 
<br>quite some time. But there was no more he could do for her and he had to look forward to his 
<br>journey. He fastened the last rope on his wagon and turned towards his fellow merchants. Their 
<br>whole caravan was waiting just outside the North Gate of Shima. It was towering over them with 
<br>the huge walls to either side. It was build for over ten years by thousands or people. Sadly, in that 
<br>time there were still slaves who had to build it. There was great literature written by former slaves 
<br>working on the walls. Full of hardships and abuse, but also strangely positive. But he was dreaming 
<br>away again. Focus Cy, he told himself.
<br>For the moment he only knew the head merchant Aratos and his wife Calandi, who were the ones 
<br>giving orders and seeing over the whole process. Aratos was a small rather heavy guy with dark 
<br>locks and a long beard. Like all merchants he was wearing the typical small golden nose rings to 
<br>identify as one of the three great merchant guilds. His wife Calandi had long, open raven hair and 
<br>was much taller than her husband. The only other feature the Professor could really distinguish from
<br>her was her rather big nose. It was unusually long. The other two dozen men were either lower 
<br>merchants or soldiers, armed and ready to protect the caravan if necessary. But if push came to 
<br>shove the Professor was sure they wouldn't hold out for long. Most weapons had rust on them, their 
<br>shields had cracks and dents. At one point he heard basically all their names, but he didn't bother to 
<br>memorize any of them. He wouldn't have to engage with them much anyways so why bother, he 
<br>thought to himself.
<br>The Professor walked up to Calandi to get something else to do. Standing around idly was not 
<br>something he was fond of doing. "Is there anything else I can help you with, Calandi?" he asked 
<br>politely.
<br>Calandi quickly turned around to him seeming a little flustered. "Oh Professor, er I mean Cy. I sure 
<br>hope I won't mess it up for too much longer, you have to forgive me I am not the fastest thinker."
<br>You don't say. "Oh that is quite alright. You are doing a fine job", he reassured her. "But is there 
<br>nothing I can lend you my aid for? I feel rather useless. Everybody is doing at least something."
<br>"Well", she looked around when the Professor noticed a little clipboard in her right hand. She 
<br>followed his gaze and looked down at the papers on her board. "Ah yes, I was checking up on our 
<br>inventory and was doing some overhead calculating of what we still need to buy for supplies in the 
<br>outer cities. You could check my numbers if you are interested. I presume you are even more trained
<br>with numbers than I am." Was she starting to blush, the Professor asked himself. He wasn't sure 
<br>why.
<br>"I would be delighted to give my mind something to do. If I may?" Calandi offered him the 
<br>clipboard and a refined charcoal pencil. It didn't need more than a quick glance to see what kind of 
<br>mess this woman had made on the paper. Nothing was lined up, a big table with croaked lines, 
<br>comments everywhere and half of the words were messily crossed out because she made a mistake 
<br>or thought of something else. He let out a short burst of amused laughter, which he regretted 
<br>instantly.
<br>"Is something the matter?" Calandi asked him. Strangely enough she didn't sound offended in the 
<br>slightest and when the Professor looked up from the messy paper he saw no trace of hurt feelings, 
<br>but something he could only interpret as fear. "I know it's probably not up to your standards and my 
<br>apologies, but it was a last minute sketch up. I normally don't do things this way, but we had some 
<br>last minute changes coming up with your arrival and your companion and then-"
<br>"My what?" the Professor stuttered.
<br>"Your companion?" she asked again. The Professor looked at her puzzled. "Oh I was informed by a 
<br>royal messenger, a very impressive woman I have to say, that we will be joined by a companion of 
<br>yours when we get near the border. Some sort of helper? I don't really remember, she was quite 
<br>intimidating and I thought it was all cleared up with you before hand."
<br>"Yes, yes", he said. "I remember now. I am sorry to have startled you. I wasn't thinking right. Must 
<br>have slipped my mind for a minute." Were they giving him a babysitter or was this some different 
<br>plot he had no knowledge of yet?
<br>"Oh no problem, Professor, er Cy. Oh I am such a slow bird sometimes. You are not at fault here."
<br>Getting back to the papers the Professor made some changes of certain numbers and totals. She had 
<br>definitely problems keeping track of the carry with additions and she sometimes forgot to add 
<br>proper estimates. He was no merchant, but a hundred gold pieces per sack of rice was at least ten 
<br>times as expensive as it should be. Even in these times where the agriculture wasn't exactly 
<br>flourishing. He handed it back to her with a smile, "I made some changes. Just a couple of little 
<br>mistakes with the numbers, but nothing neck breaking."
<br>Calandi looked back at him with big eyes. Looked down at the paper and back up. "You went 
<br>through all of that in a few seconds?" she asked sounding like a child almost. "I have to apologize 
<br>again, but what we heard of you wasn't putting you in a good light at all. But this is beyond 
<br>amazing. I have to.. wait here for a moment, I will be right back." She left the Professor standing 
<br>there puzzled and amused. Amazed by simple addition, subtraction and multiplication. What would 
<br>their evening conversations be about, he asked himself. Repeating old tales and legends? A lot of 
<br>silence? Talking about their faiths? Pathetic.
<br>And then it got into his mind. What would he do for the whole day marching through empty country
<br>side? Watching the vegetation and animal life wouldn't satisfy him for more than a few minutes or 
<br>an hour a day. Would he succumb to making small talk with the other merchants or soldiers?
<br>"Clair..", the Professor sighed looking from one faceless soldier to the next. They all looked and felt
<br>the same, like empty vessels. But rather than them, vessel were at least useful for something.
<br>"How often did I tell you, I hate it when men sigh my name like that." Turning around the Professor
<br>couldn't even contain the grin if he wanted to. But he absolutely didn't. Clair was walking up to him,
<br>wearing a thick coat with the hood drawn back exposing her short, pitch black hair and caramel 
<br>colored skin.
<br>"Do you come here to torture me with fake hope or are you actually considering joining me?" He 
<br>sounded a bit too hopeful.
<br>"Even if that could be rather funny, I am here to join you. Can't let you wander around on your own 
<br>out there, can I? And who will be the mediator between these guys", she gestured towards the other 
<br>men and women surrounding the caravan, "and you. I sure hope you didn't insult all of them 
<br>already, did you?"
<br>"I actually think the merchants wife, Calandi, has found quite the liking to me actually. But Clair", 
<br>he got serious again, "what about-"
<br>"I have thought about it this last week. And what do you always say, facts don't lie. I put it all 
<br>together like you always do. I can't say it yet out loud, but we both know the truth. It's just easier to 
<br>hold on to hope, even when there is none left for the rational mind. I have not forsaken him though 
<br>and I will continue my search, but only after we have returned." The Professor could see how much 
<br>it took out of her to say this, it must have been even more to come to this conclusion. Her brother 
<br>San was all she could think about, every single day. But she was right, they both knew it for a long 
<br>time. She picked up her gaze from the ground and looked at him with a scheming smile, "Won't you
<br>say anything to stop me, Professor? I mean we are venturing through dangerous territory. Don't you 
<br>want to tell me to stay here where it's safe?"
<br>"Don't be ridiculous. This city is probably twice as dangerous as the grassland if we are being 
<br>honest. And if I die on this trip I sure hope I don't have to do it alone." He smiled. She smiled back.
<br>"But what are we going to do about the virus?" she asked.
<br>"I have taken all the instruments and supplies we need to do some basic experiments. But I doubt 
<br>we will be successful without a lot of help from the tribe's healers. And we can't count on that at all. 
<br>Understandably they hold a little grudge against us people."
<br>"So we are fucked."
<br>"Nicely put. To be more precise, the nation is fucked, if we don't find a miraculous way of making 
<br>this work."
<br>"Well, if anyone can do it, then the great Professor himself, isn't that right?"
<br>Instead of answering, the Professor looked over the city sprouting over the several hills it was built 
<br>upon. The sun was coming up and reflecting off the colored roofs. He didn't have a strong 
<br>relationship with this city, the only friend he had was standing next to him about to leave. But the 
<br>thought of seeing it fall into chaos let knots grow in his stomach. It was the closest thing he had to a
<br>home and even the closest Clair had to a home. A pathetic thought, that they had nothing more than 
<br>this Gods forsaken city.
<br>#
<br>The wagons rattled over the bumpy cobblestone road next to Clair. The air felt unusually clean and 
<br>fresh. It was good to be outside the confines of the giant capital. The wind was brushing her short 
<br>hair and cheeks. To her disliking, they had to walk the whole way, because all of the wagons were 
<br>reserved for cargo and the few bulls they had were already at their maximum capacity, heaving 
<br>under the immense weight they had to pull. She hoped they would make it back and not break a leg 
<br>somewhere around the road and end up being made into food for the travelers. Right next to her a 
<br>black bull was slowly walking forward. She put out her hand caressing his head earning a satisfied 
<br>him from the giant animal. She checked the straps running all around his body, seeing if they didn't 
<br>cut into his skin at any point.
<br>Looking back at the city, Clair felt a big emptiness in her heart. Searching the wall she wasn't 
<br>disappointed to see a little figure standing on top the battlements. Even from the distance she saw 
<br>ice blue eyes piercing her gaze. She felt tears running down her cheeks without noticing they had 
<br>been starting to form. Slowly the figure started walking forward closer to the edge. She could her 
<br>his voice inside her head, calling for her, begging her to help him. To safe him. I am hurt big sister, 
<br>he cried out, please. I need you.
<br>You aren't real, she told herself trying to close her eyes, but not succeeding. She couldn't help but 
<br>watch her brother get closer to the edge. This was all her fault. She should have been more careful, 
<br>should have been less naive. Why did she trust that slug Sakara. Her sweet words were nothing but 
<br>poison. No wonder they called her, the Viper.
<br>"Is he there?" the Professor asked, touching her lightly on the shoulder and bringing her back to 
<br>herself.
<br>"Yes", she whispered back.
<br>He put his arm around her shoulders and pulled her gently to the side, so she couldn't look back 
<br>anymore, but was forced to see ahead onto the road. "The best thing we can do for him is go 
<br>forward with our research. The plague will hit the poorer districts first, where the rats roam free."
<br>"I know", she said trying to compose herself again. "But my mind keeps telling me otherwise. I can 
<br>still hear his voice", her voice broke abruptly. At least the nightmares were getting less extreme and 
<br>there were nights she would sleep more than two hours.
<br>"What would you think if we started some drama around here?" he asked all of the sudden.
<br>She looked at him sideways. Weirdly enough his crude manners were always helping her in these 
<br>situations. Everything occupying her mind instead of this was something she couldn't say no to. 
<br>"What kind of drama do you want to start? You know we have to travel with these people for quite a
<br>while. It wouldn't be wise to upset them and make enemies, would it?"
<br>"Simple minded Clair. Have you forgotten my unbelievable genius. My plans never fail, do they?"
<br>"One time you were sent to prison. Then once you almost lost your job and your students had to beg
<br>their parents to buy you back your job. Oh, and then there was the time you-"
<br>"Alright, alright", he laughed, but his eyes were sparkling with enthusiasm. "Only this time we are 
<br>in a different position. These people aren't, let's say, the brightest sapphires in the world, are they? I 
<br>am sure we can get away with a lot. Especially because they all think I am a renowned scientist and 
<br>professor. Who would dare to put the blame on someone like me?"
<br>"Great. Then they will just blame me. It was hard enough to get them to accept me coming with 
<br>you. We even have to buy some extra supplies still to have enough. I don't want to press Calandi 
<br>even more. Your charm isn't strong enough to make her stand against her own husband."
<br>"You already gave me a great idea, my friend. Indeed my charm normally isn't on par with most 
<br>other men, but with her it seems different. Not only is she impressed by my intelligence, but I have 
<br>the impression she is also interested in more than just my brain. I noticed her eyes keep wandering 
<br>when she thinks I am not looking."
<br>"Come on", Clair exclaimed all too loud. "You can't be serious. What are you seeing already again. I
<br>thought I am the only one with delusions and hallucinations." Big sister, a whisper riding on the 
<br>edges of the wind to her ears. It sounded like the rustling of leaves and not like a voice, but it was 
<br>unmistakably San's.
<br>"Watch. Closely." He started walking faster to catch up with Calandi, who was walking at the top of
<br>the caravan. In total Clair counted about three dozen wagons rattling over the royal road. The 
<br>surrounding people were walking in little groups of not more than three, talking or walking in 
<br>silence. The bulls were breathing heavily. Clair went past the little groups to catch up with the 
<br>Professor slowly. She wanted to stay out of sight, but still hear what he would say to her.
<br>"Is it alright if I join you for a bit, Calandi?" the Professor asked when he finally caught up with her.
<br>She was rather tall for a woman and wasn't looking like a child next to her, in contrary to Clair 
<br>herself.
<br>"Oh, it's you Professor, I mean Cy of course. I will get it down, don't you worry one bit." She did 
<br>seemed flustered already. 
<br>"I have no doubt you will get it down in no time." Clair could hear the smile in his voice. Where did
<br>he take that confidence to talk to a stranger like this? "I was only wondering, what you were 
<br>thinking about?" Clair's eyes rolled so far back she must have looked like a demon. "Walking 
<br>through this empty countryside is beginning to bore me. My company isn't a great help either. So I 
<br>kept wondering what you might be thinking about just now?" When he finished I will punch him in 
<br>the stomach, she thought. She would go for the face, but it sadly was out of reach for her little arms.
<br>"Oh, you were wondering about me?" Her voice went unusually high. "But isn't she like your 
<br>student? Wouldn't that make her a way better person to talk to then the simple minded merchant 
<br>wife I am?"
<br>"On the contrary", the Professor reassured her, "she might be my disciple, but that is the problem. 
<br>She is still learning and growing up, a mere child if we are being honest for a moment. I love her 
<br>with all my heart. She is like family to me and family is so, so important, wouldn't you agree?"
<br>She nodded frantically. "But I often long for a more adult conversation, with proper topics. I don't 
<br>want to be the teacher all the time. It gets so exhausting."
<br>"I totally understand. I have two children myself and it gets really annoying and troublesome to be 
<br>the parent all the time. So but, oh, what was I thinking about? I don't really know." She knew very 
<br>well, Clair was sure, but she was trying to think of something more interesting to impress the 
<br>Professor. "I was just thinking about random things, you know? Like, what is the purpose of our 
<br>lives? I often get these kind of thoughts when I am walking through the country on our trips, you 
<br>know?"
<br>"A discussion about the very nature of our existence, how fascinating you would think about 
<br>something like this in this empty landscape. I knew my gut feeling about you was right. You know 
<br>what they say about us scholars, as real truth-seekers we can't ignore our gut feeling. And am I 
<br>allowed to hear the conclusion you came to regarding the purpose of our existence? I am dying to 
<br>hear."
<br>"Oh, but isn't it in the nature of the question", she began her pathetic pseudo intellectual answer. 
<br>Clair didn't like how she was changing things about herself to impress someone else. You shouldn't 
<br>play the part for someone else and forsake yourself. It never works out anyways, so why bother. She
<br>had seen it everywhere, but especially when working for Sakara, the Viper. "That you can't really 
<br>find an answer to the question. I think only the Gods know the answer to that question. They are the
<br>ones who created everything and therefore also the purpose of us. But I am interested to hear your 
<br>own thoughts of course. They are probably way more thoughtful and not as simple as mine."
<br>"It actually hurts me physically how you put yourself down here. Don't let anyone tell you, you are 
<br>too simple to think about these kind of questions. Even if someone doesn't agree with you, it's no 
<br>reason to think your view of the world is any less sophisticated than theirs. I for my part-" Sadly the
<br>Professor was interrupted by Aratos, Calandis husband and head merchant of the caravan. Busted, 
<br>Clair thought. This didn't look good. He was scowling at the Professor.
<br>"What are you two talking about?" he grunted at his wife.
<br>"Oh, Aratos. Nothing really. Just some small talk for passing the time." She was casting her gaze 
<br>down towards the ground. So the Professor actually was right, she felt exposed. Clair couldn't 
<br>refrain from smiling, only barely keeping herself from laughing out loud.
<br>Another grunt from Aratos. "I need your help with something. One of the ledgers is wrong, I want 
<br>you to look over it again before we arrive in Jorda."
<br>"And I will keep you no longer. It was a pleasure to talk with you, Calandi. Until next time." The 
<br>Professor slowed down and starting walking next to Clair again.
<br>"Have I promised too much?" he asked. No he hadn't. "The bait is thrown out."
<br>#
<br>It was almost nightfall when they finally arrived in the smaller outskirt town of Jorda. The Professor
<br>had made a few more attempts of conversation with Calandi and was shut down by her husband 
<br>every time, but he could already feel the tension growing. It was getting interesting definitely.
<br>"You seem more tense than usual", Clair said from the side. She was having her hood over her head,
<br>the air was getting cold and even the Professor was feeling a bit chilly. "Are you afraid you have to 
<br>go further than just talk with Calandi after you led her on so much?"
<br>"On the contrary, I think I won't be able to go through with it at all. It's getting more and more 
<br>difficult to keep myself contain."
<br>"Can you elaborate?"
<br>"Did you notice how often she says 'oh'?" he asked.
<br>"Oh, I did notice", Clair laughed. The laughter was making the Professor relax for a moment. He 
<br>knew it was wrong to play with Calandi's feelings like this, but to cheer Clair up even a bit he 
<br>would do way worse things without hesitating for a second.
<br>"I thought it would be fun to talk with her, but in actuality, it gets my insides boiling. I can't take her
<br>pseudo talk anymore. It's not even that I find her dumb or bland, but if you don't have the capacity 
<br>or experience with certain things, why fake it for some stranger? I mean I fake interest in her 
<br>thoughts, alright, but at leasts I don't make up stuff."
<br>"And here I thought you finally found the woman of your dreams. Snatching her away from a sad 
<br>and unfulfilled marriage, riding into the sunset on your bull led caravan. Staring into each other's 
<br>eyes and confessing your undying love for each other."
<br>The Professor scowled at her. "I rather die alone than settle for her."
<br>The little city of Jorda was building up before them. The road was still in top shape out here, but the
<br>houses were tiny in comparison to the capital. The wall was made out of mud and wood and barely 
<br>high enough to provide safety from people with basic climbing skills. A couple watch towers were 
<br>sprinkled around the perimeter with lightning sapphire lamps giving up their cool pulsating light.
<br>"Did you know I was here once before?"
<br>"Really? How come?"
<br>"My parents took me here when I was, hm, maybe about five or so. I remember because there was a
<br>spring festival here and my father had some contractor work he needed to take care of while my 
<br>mother, my and baby San were enjoying the festival. In my memory it was so much bigger, even 
<br>though I knew the capital well by then."
<br>The Professor would have liked to stroll around the little city and see what she remembered from 
<br>her childhood. But he was too afraid of ripping open some old wounds. This was a precious 
<br>moment all together, her speaking of her parents at all was so rare he was delighted it happened at 
<br>all. But with not knowing what to answer he stayed quiet.
<br>They walked on next to the caravan seeing light in the surrounding houses, mostly pulsating 
<br>sapphires. The Professor looked around and saw on a small elevation further towards the heart of 
<br>Jordan a high tower gleaming in the last sun rays. Their lightning rod was nothing compared to the 
<br>ones inside the capital, but it was a beauty nonetheless. A perfectly straight iron rod stretching far 
<br>into the sky, about thirty meters the Professor guessed, ending probably in a building at the bottom. 
<br>He couldn't see it from here, but it sure was there. It was where the sapphires and lightning rod were
<br>connected via some more cables. It was a fascinating process watching the gems charge during a 
<br>thunderstorm. With every lightning hitting the rod the bunch of sapphires connected to it would 
<br>light up tremendously, several times brighter than they would be when fully charged even, and then 
<br>sort of cool of slowly and stabilizing until they were charged fully. Without any use they could last 
<br>for weeks giving off their cold, blue light.
<br>"Calandi isn't the reason you are so tense, is it?" Clair's voice cut him out of his thoughts. He almost
<br>forgot she was there for a moment and jumped at her sound. He couldn't see her face with the hood 
<br>over her head.
<br>"No it isn't", he admitted. The merchant's wife was a welcome distraction not only for Clair, but for 
<br>him as well. He still was unsure who this mystery companion would be, he was supposedly meeting
<br>here in Jordan. He didn't understand the need for a bodyguard especially, because the Professor was 
<br>quite sure, Zalan was loving the idea of him dying somewhere out in the grasslands. There were 
<br>enough dangers besides raids and bandit tribes, but he was actually having to look for some form of 
<br>antidote he would need to befriend some of the tribe's healers. Getting close to them wasn't easy and
<br>he didn't have much knowledge at all about their culture or customs. It was dangerous, but a single 
<br>man wouldn't turn the tides in any of these cases. Maybe he was there to keep taps on the Professor 
<br>and Clair? Was he there to stab him in the back somewhere way out in the no man's land? It was 
<br>unsettling, and not in a good way.
<br>"We will be getting some company, send from the royal treasury, or to be more exact, from Zalan. I 
<br>think we will meet him in the inn we are staying tonight. It is unnerving me."
<br>"Do you think they send him with us to kill you?" she asked bluntly. He was impressed, the same 
<br>thought came to her, too. "Or us both maybe?"
<br>"Well, I wouldn't worry about your life, if I were you. He will be struck by your unbelievable 
<br>beauty and intellect. He won't even be able to lift a finger to hurt you, without a doubt. I think the 
<br>biggest danger you are facing from him, is him not being able to contain his love."
<br>"If it's only love I won't mind so much, but with most men it's lust they have a problem to contain", 
<br>she said with a bitter undertone.
<br>Aratos came up to them walking along the caravan. It looked like they were coming up on the 
<br>market place in the center of the settlement. "The wagons, animals and a few men for protections 
<br>will camp on the south side of the city. We will be staying at the Sapphire Rose tonight. You can go 
<br>ahead with most of the men and let them know we are coming. I don't need you to make the caravan
<br>safe for the night." He almost said the last remark as an insult it appeared to the Professor.
<br>"Very well", he said trying to sound as nice as possible, "we will try to get you a place close to the 
<br>fire with some warm stew or whatever they are best at."
<br>He earned a grunt from Aratos, who was already leaving only listening with half an ear probably. It 
<br>was almost comical how he started hating his guts.
<br>"I guess you two won't become friends any time soon", Clair said.
<br>"What a shame. Let's go and see what this inn is like. I am dying for something to eat, aren't you."
<br>They followed the rest of the men down towards a bigger building made from mostly a rich brown 
<br>wood with a cobblestone base. The windows were a dark blue tint, which where the inn probably 
<br>got it's name from. It made the sapphire lanterns shining from inside even more blue. Entering 
<br>through the front door, the air smelled of smoke, good food and sweat. Just like any other inn worth 
<br>its salt, the Professor thought. The inn would barely fit all of the caravan's people inside, but luckily
<br>for them not many from the town folk were inside anyways. Must have cleared up for them 
<br>beforehand.
<br>"Are you alright, Clair?"
<br>"I don't like the air", she answered removing her hood and unbuttoning her coat. The Professor did 
<br>it just the same. "But I will be alright, I think. I would prefer a table on the edges though, if that is 
<br>possible."
<br>"Certainly." The Professor walked through the open dining room, two fires crackling at the far side 
<br>of the room giving off a nice warm feeling. Behind the counter the innkeeper was already filling up 
<br>mugs with ale. He was a burly old man with a long, but well kept beard. It went down far beyond 
<br>his chest and was cut off by the counter. How far did it go down?
<br>"Greetings, what are you serving tonight for some hungry travelers?" the Professor asked leaning 
<br>onto the counter.
<br>"Welcome to our humble inn. My name is Harlo, the gentle Bear. Please make yourself at home in 
<br>the renowned Shining Sapphire. You are in luck, my wife has been preparing our famous sheep stew
<br>with fresh vegetables and as dessert some sweet pancakes with butter. How does that sound to you 
<br>two?" Humble, but renowned? the Professor asked himself.
<br>"Sounds delicious. We will be seated at the corner over there."
<br>"My daughters will be right there with your food. Relax and enjoy the fire and some good ale." He 
<br>offered them two mugs, which Clair happily took from him without another blink.
<br>Suddenly, the other men from their caravan started a commotion over to his left. The Professor and 
<br>Clair were trying to look what was going on when two small young women emerges from the 
<br>cluster of weary men. Both had long braided black hair hanging down way beyond their waist even.
<br>They must be the daughters the innkeeper had been speaking of. They both were wearing tight 
<br>fitting traditional hanuka dresses. A form of dress where a high slit was on the right side of the 
<br>woman giving sight to undergarment, most commonly blue stockings. To balance the symmetry the 
<br>left arm had a long sleeve going half over the hand and the right arm was barely covered half way 
<br>towards the elbow.
<br>"Would you look at that", Clair exclaimed, "twins." The Professor had to look again. They were 
<br>looking exactly identically. He hadn't even noticed. Same eyes, nose, stature, even hairstyle. He was
<br>so hung up on their clothing and entrance, that he hadn't noticed the obvious. Fascinating to find 
<br>identical twins out here in this little town indeed. "Sakara would weep with joy finding them here. 
<br>Let's go and let them have their fun." She went off towards the table they had observed before.
<br>The Professor followed, but not after taking another good look at the twins trying to entertain the 
<br>new visitors. It was going to rain tips tonight, he was sure of it. Quite the rare find it was indeed. 
<br>What kind of knowledge one could gain from perfectly identical people, the asked himself. Hard to 
<br>say.
<br>Clair sat down at their little table, facing the stone wall with one of the blue stained windows at  her 
<br>left side. She liked it more to not have to see all the people in the room and given the tavern was 
<br>filled to the brim already, awaiting even more when Aratos and his helping crew arrived. To the 
<br>Professor it was a mystery how it felt better to have them all in her back rather than in front of her 
<br>and being able to see what they were up to. But everyone was indeed different, he thought.
<br>The food arrived shortly after, brought by both of the beautiful twins. Now that he had a better look,
<br>he was sure, they were not only beautiful, but stunning. The hanuka dress fit perfectly down to 
<br>every single curve of their bodies. Their heavy braids in perfect shape and hazel eyes unusually 
<br>large. One of the talents the Professor prided himself on, was his skill to get the overall intellect 
<br>from a person by just a quick glance at how they act or talk. But these twins were a complete 
<br>mystery to him. He would even go as far as to say, they looked as dumb as they come at first, but he
<br>also thought it was mostly a front to impress the customers and give them an experience, where they
<br>felt superior and would tip more. And if that was true, they were smarter than he gave them credit at
<br>first sight.
<br>"Stop staring", Claire whispered over the table and hit him on the arm with a soft punch. "Where 
<br>have you left your manners? Is this they way one treats fair ladies like these?"
<br>"I abandoned those long ago when I understood a man like me won't leave a lasting impression on a
<br>woman if he is just like all the other men dabbling for their attention."
<br>"So you decided to act like a creep and stare at them from a far? Great thinking there as usual, my 
<br>honored teacher. Please continue, I am sure it will yield the promised result in no time."
<br>The Professor glared at her, "I think I definitely got more women into bed than you have, don't I?"
<br>"Definitely not, but please keep talking about your accomplishments in getting women into bed. It 
<br>truly is a fascinating topic I never were allowed to learn from you about. How does one charm a 
<br>woman into having sex?"
<br>"You really think you had more women in bed than me?" Somehow this statement stung.
<br>"Tell me a number and I tell you if we are close?"
<br>The Professor eyes her from across the table, she stared back. Without blinking they took a bite 
<br>from the food. Nobody said a word. He started counting in his head though, sadly enough it was a 
<br>short list and not quite as impressive as he thought it would have been. But he sure had more than 
<br>Clair, hadn't he. Clair took a sip from her ale, long and fast gulps.
<br>Come on just say it, he thought to himself. Nothing to be ashamed of, is there. No there wasn't. 
<br>"Four." A shower of ale spewed over their table, hit the Professor in the face and wet his clothes. It 
<br>was followed by a mixture of laughing and coughing from Clair. Now this was not the reaction he 
<br>was expecting at all.
<br>"Alright, don't exaggerate now. People are starting to suspiciously look over to our table."
<br>Clair wiped off some ale from her mouth with the sleeve of her shirt. "You are right. I am sorry, I 
<br>just didn't think it would be that low. I expected at least ten. Aren't you like over thirty or 
<br>something?" She was still laughing.
<br>Somehow it was triggering a response in the Professor he wasn't aware of all too often, he started to
<br>blush. "Four is an absolutely acceptable amount of sexual partners. Do you know how many marry 
<br>their first one and start a family without ever sleeping with another person?"
<br>"Yes, it's not that common actually. Everybody cheats someday. Trust me. But in your case, I know 
<br>for a fact, you also slept with at least one prostitute. So who are you wanting to impress with a mere
<br>four." Now his cheeks started burning indeed. Blood rushing to his face, what a pleasant feeling 
<br>actually, he thought. He didn't understand why everybody hated it so much. The rising heat was a 
<br>bit too much, but the tingling was interesting indeed.
<br>"So?" he asked instead.
<br>"So?" Clair asked back, taking another bite from her food.
<br>"If you are keep being so arrogant, tell me your number then. I didn't know of many women enter 
<br>certain establishments." The words slipped past his tongue so fast, he wasn't even thinking about 
<br>them. It was hard to know when one could joke about Clair's past and when not to. Some days she 
<br>was hurt by the slightest comment and sometimes they would joke about every little fucked up thing
<br>she were telling him.
<br>"That's the problem when you only get your knowledge from old, dusty books. I don't know a 
<br>number and that should already saw enough. But I remember days I had more women in my bed 
<br>than you ever will apparently."
<br>"Shut up."
<br>"It's true though", she said shaking her head. "Fucking four." She laughed again and this time he 
<br>joined in.
<br>"Alright, I understand. Let's not pull that topic out again." The Professor noticed a stranger enter the
<br>tavern, clad in light leather armor with a curved sword on his right. His equipment was way too 
<br>expensive to be one of the mercenaries or one of the town's folk. Was he the man they were waiting 
<br>for. He wore a flat, black hat and a piece of cloth before his face so you couldn't see more than his 
<br>eyes.
<br>"I think I have found our mystery companion", he said to Clair, but she didn't seem to care.
<br>"If he is here to kill us, tell him to make it quick", she said and kept eating. She was already almost 
<br>finished with her plate, while the Professor had barely eaten two bites. Her mug of ale was probably
<br>empty too, so he exchanged the two mugs, which earned him a delighted smile and Clair took 
<br>another big gulp.
<br>The mystery men looked around and for a moment the two locked eyes and the man stopped, 
<br>removed his hat and the cloth revealing his face. He was older, maybe ten years older than the 
<br>Professor and had a long, vertical scar on his cheek, which started at his nose and ended somewhere
<br>at his ear. And even the ear seemed to have experienced some scarring. His hair was combed back 
<br>into a bun at the back of his head. He leisurely strolled over to their table, hat in hand.
<br>"I suppose you are the Professor Cy I am looking for", he said with a voice so deep only a lifelong 
<br>habit of smoking could achieve. The Professor wanted to reply, but suddenly Clair jumped from her 
<br>seat, taking the knife from the table and dashed to the side. Her chair toppled over and cracked on 
<br>the stone floor. She lunged over to the Professor, who already got up from his chair unsure what 
<br>was happening. He looked at Clair's eyes and saw giant dilated pupils, sweat forming on her 
<br>forehead, breathing heavily and her tiny hand clasping the knife so tight her knuckles were snow 
<br>white, was shaking immensely. Rising to his full height, he stood next to her facing this man, who 
<br>seemed to have sparked some deep rooted panic in Clair.
<br>"Long time no see, little Clair", the raspy voice said with a grin on his face, "I see you have grown 
<br>up quite a bit. Sakara sends her regards. She will be delighted to hear you are well and in good 
<br>shape with your new.. friend." The Professor's heart dropped, he felt a chill go over his body and 
<br>was suddenly aware everybody was staring at them. He stepped in front of Clair covering her with 
<br>his body. The lightning sapphire around his neck started tingling, when he felt his rage rise. So they 
<br>had finally come to take her back.
<br>He had swore to never let that happen and by the Gods he had no intention of breaking that promise.<br></p>
