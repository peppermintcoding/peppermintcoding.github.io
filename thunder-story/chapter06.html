            <p>Chapter 5
<br>
<br>
<br>Clair's feet were already hurting from the constant walking through out the day. They had left the 
<br>small village of Jorda a couple of weeks back and were approaching the border to the endless 
<br>grasslands. She caressed one of the bulls walking next to her, this one particularly liked it if you 
<br>touched his face. He liked it between his eyes, too.
<br>"Clair, we have to do something", Cy said, who had been walking silently beside her this whole 
<br>time. He wasn't in a good mood ever since Deko, the former right hand of Sakara, had made his 
<br>appearance and was now walking peacefully two wagons ahead of them.
<br>"And what do you suppose we do?" she asked. "He has the seal of the Emperor. He was sent by the 
<br>Royal Treasury, we can't just kill him and think nothing will happen to us."
<br>"Nobody said anything about killing him, but good to know where your head is at." There was 
<br>genuine concern in his voice, "You can't go on like this. How much do you sleep each night? One 
<br>hour, maybe two when the exhaustion gets the better of you? You can't even sleep if I stay up. It's 
<br>ruining you beauty."
<br>"Would you be able to sleep if the man who brought you into Sakara's hands was sleeping just a few
<br>steps away from you? Do you really think he is genuine about what he said? That he is not working 
<br>for her anymore and isn't going to do anything to me, but actually was chosen to protect the both of 
<br>us. How can I trust this piece of shit after all that has happened?"
<br>"I was thinking about a couple of things", Cy began, ignoring her words apparently, "we have to 
<br>stage something and get him into a position, where the others are forced to deal with him. Some 
<br>form of crime maybe, but I don't know what that would be. He doesn't seem to be the reckless and 
<br>stupid type. We have to be careful about this."
<br>"Even if we get him to steal something or I don't know, hit you in the face, it wouldn't change a 
<br>thing. Nobody will raise a hand against someone with a royal seal."
<br>"So something more serious. A capital crime then."
<br>"Sure, let's make him kill a random stranger here and see what happens. Maybe next time you could
<br>think for at least a second before spewing out that crap at me."
<br>Cy looked over at her, but she avoided his glance. "You are quite short-tempered when you are 
<br>suffering from sleep deprivation. Not very surprising, but still interesting. Let's channel that energy 
<br>into something productive though. Think, Clair."
<br>He didn't deserve the way she spoke with him, but she couldn't help it. He was right, the constant 
<br>sleepless nights had made her be on edge the whole time. Everything was enraging her, even feeling
<br>a bigger pebble underneath her boots would bring her close to erupting and punching something.
<br>Calandi came strolling towards them, talking a little to every group she passed before moving 
<br>further down the caravan. When she finally approached them, she had a smile on her face as wide as
<br>her nose was long. Her long hair was playing in the wind, "How are you doing today, Clair", she 
<br>asked. "I hope you slept a little better this night."
<br>"Yes, a bit better", she answered trying to smile.
<br>"Oh, lying again, are we?" She was shaking her head. "Cy, why aren't you making her something to 
<br>let her sleep. Some sort of brew or, oh I don't know, there must be a plant around here to help her 
<br>sleep."
<br>"I tried everything, Calandi", he sighed, "but she wouldn't take anything. I really am out of my 
<br>wits."
<br>"Well, you two are in luck. I will make this right. You will lie down right now, Clair, and I will not 
<br>have another discussion. These bulls are strong enough to carry your small body for a couple of 
<br>hours."
<br>"I told you, I don't-"
<br>"And I told you to not discuss this with me!" she exclaimed playfully angry. "Cy and I will be 
<br>walking just next to you, within touching distance. Oh and I will make sure this man with the scar, 
<br>won't come anywhere close to you without waking you, don't you worry."
<br>"How did you know?" the Professor asked.
<br>"Oh, everybody can see the way she looks at that man and I heard what happened in the inn. I might
<br>be not as fast with numbers as you, but with people I can run circles around you, my dear 
<br>professor." Clair laughed, but actually climbed onto the wagon right next to them. She mentally 
<br>apologized to the bulls having to pull even more weight now. "I got you a little blanket here as 
<br>well." The blanket she pulled out from underneath her arm was a clean white with little yellow 
<br>flowers on it. It wasn't a very thick blanket, but the weather was getting milder the longer they 
<br>journey went. Summer was arriving.
<br>"And now you will sleep in no time." Calandi brushed through Clair's hair before tucking her in a 
<br>little lighter. "You have nothing to fear around here", she whispered in her ear. "This is my caravan. 
<br>Here I am the empress." She smiled even wider and walked over to the Professor, who also smiled a
<br>little at her.
<br>The warm, comfortable blanket and the unsteady wagon was making her sleepy in seconds. Weeks 
<br>of no sleep had been taking its toil on her. She heard Cy and Calandi start up a conversation, but 
<br>couldn't understand a single word before finally falling asleep.
<br>#
<br>"I hope you don't mind me asking", said the Professor, "but why do you keep on going out of your 
<br>way to care for Clair?"
<br>"Well", Calandi answered, "because apparently you are doing a horrible job yourself."
<br>"I", he stuttered, but was interrupted by laughter.
<br>"Don't worry, I didn't mean it that way. A little joke, that's all it was." She paused for a moment. "I 
<br>don't really understand what it is, but when I look at her I feel my heart feel very heavy. I want to 
<br>protect her, even if that makes no sense. She is not my child."
<br>"She is no child at all, I forget that myself quite often. She is a grown woman by now, almost 
<br>nineteen years old. Sometimes she seems to be older than me, just by what she says, but on other 
<br>occasions, she seems not much older than a child. You should have known her when I met her. The 
<br>most interesting mind I have ever met, not a scholar from the council or a professor at the 
<br>university. No, a girl from the streets with anxious eyes."
<br>They walked in silence for a bit, the rubble underneath the Professor's boots crunched with every 
<br>step. The land around them had changed significantly, from fields of rice and other grain as far as 
<br>the eye could see to a deserted grassland. No farmer dared to cultivate land so far out, even though 
<br>the border was only approaching. He didn't know if the raids were still common out near the border 
<br>or if that had changed in the last years. He wasn't much interested in these affairs.
<br>"Can I ask something personal?" Calandi said all of the sudden.
<br>"Always, but I don't know if I can give you the answer you want."
<br>"So you already guessed it. Oh, of course you did. But still, what happened to her?"
<br>It was a simple question really. He knew the story, well most of it at least he thought. Clair wasn't 
<br>very talkative about her past and he wasn't either, but somehow they managed to get pieces of each 
<br>other every now and again. Most of the time when they were drunk. "I am sorry, but I don't feel 
<br>comfortable speaking about that without her knowledge or without asking her beforehand. She is a 
<br>very secretive person and I know she is beginning to like you, but not enough to converse with you 
<br>about these kinds of topics. Please don't take it personal, I myself had to piece a lot together without
<br>her telling me. But some things get very obvious when you get to know some details."
<br>"Then I am glad she found you. I think you two make quite the lovely little family."
<br>Family. Was this what they were to each other? "I guess we just both have nobody else, so it's only 
<br>natural to stay together if you can tolerate the other person."
<br>"Oh", she said a little hesitant, "I didn't know you had not family either. I am so sorry to hear that."
<br>"You really don't have to. It wasn't quite so bad. I even remember the Emperor's father visiting our 
<br>orphanage from time to time. I learned how to fight with a sword from him personally."
<br>"You fighting with a sword?" She laughed, holding her hand in front of her mouth to cover it. "I 
<br>never imagined you have had any experience with the sword or warfare at all. You don't strike me 
<br>as that type of person."
<br>"Well, you would be surprised of what talents I hold."
<br>A sudden commotion was going through the caravan. Men were running along the line of wagons, 
<br>talking to every one of the groups and pointing back towards Shima. Calandi and the Professor 
<br>turned around and they both startled for a second. How didn't they notice an approaching 
<br>thunderstorm. This wasn't good. The weather had been so stable for the last weeks. Quite 
<br>predictable, so they had always time to find shelter along the roads. But now so far to the west the 
<br>thunderstorms normally were far less frequent and less volatile, but this one looked angry and dark.
<br>"I am sorry", Calandi said, "but I have to get to my husband and see what we are to do with this 
<br>storm." She left quickly, hurrying towards the front of the caravan.
<br>The Professor looked over to Clair, still lying on the wagon tugged in with the blanket from 
<br>Calandi. "Time to wake you again", he sighed.
<br>#
<br>"Stop it!" a voice cried out. Clair was running as fast as she could, but San was still infinitely far 
<br>away. "I didn't do anything!" he shouted again, but another slap hit him in the face. It was all her 
<br>fault, like always. She tried to shout something towards them, but the words were sucked from her 
<br>mouth before they left her lips. Then she saw another slap slowly approaching San's cheek. She saw
<br>every detail of it, the tears in his blue eyes, the giant, rough hand raining down and she was trying 
<br>so hard to get to him and help him. But as always she wasn't strong enough to do anything.
<br>Then everything happened at once. The slap hit her brother, someone touched her on the shoulder 
<br>and growling thunder brought her back into the real world. She blinked and looked into the 
<br>apologetic eyes of the Professor. "I hope the nightmares didn't bother you the whole time", he said.
<br>"Did I shout or cry again?" she asked trying to orient herself.
<br>"Not this time", he reassured her. "But I am sorry for waking you, we have a little problem." He 
<br>gestured to the right, if she wasn't turned around it was the direction where Shima was. A black 
<br>curtain was trying to swallow up the land underneath it. The thunder was already reaching them, it 
<br>was still faint, but a constant growling. They said the thunderstorms were a lot less strong out here 
<br>so far away from the mountains, but even so, hundreds of lightnings were raining down to the earth 
<br>every time she blinked. And they had no shelter near them.
<br>"What are we going to do?"
<br>"It seems, that Aratos is trying to get everybody together to answer just that question. Come one 
<br>let's go, they might need the help of these two brilliant minds." He winked at her and helped her 
<br>down from the wagon.
<br>Aratos was already standing on top of one of the wagons and a crowd of people had been gathering 
<br>in front. Calandi was nowhere to be seen, but Clair had trouble seeing anything from behind all 
<br>these men. The Professor probably had more luck.
<br>"We have studied the maps and turning back is not an option", Aratos began to talk, "and the next 
<br>shelter ahead is the border garrison, still a couple of hours away. We can only guess, but I suppose 
<br>the storm will reach us in less than an hour." The crowd began to chatter anxiously. Clair looked 
<br>around and saw Deko standing a little apart from the other men, even he looked uneasy watching 
<br>the lightning in the distance. I hope one of them has your name on it, she thought.
<br>"The ones who are fit enough can try their luck and walk ahead to the garrison outpost. I doubt any 
<br>of the bulls will make it in time, so the rest of us will have to stay behind and hope we can survive 
<br>this."
<br>"And how do you suppose we do that?" one of the soldiers shouted towards Aratos. "It's not like 
<br>these are only a few bolts, we are talking about hundreds and we have no shelter."
<br>"We do have some shelter", Aratos said nervously gesturing with his hands, "we will hide 
<br>underneath the wagons. It will give us enough protection." What was he talking about? Clair 
<br>thought.
<br>"Not only did they send us into exile", the Professor growled with closed teeth, "they also gave us a 
<br>moron merchant to take us through the grasslands. Is this his first expedition or what? How can you 
<br>be so reckless and not think about a thunderstorm before planning your route? Now all the messed 
<br>up ledgers make sense. They don't have a fucking clue what they are doing at all."
<br>"So what are we doing?" Clair asked. "Dig a hole for all of us and hope it's deep enough?"
<br>"Interesting thought, though not manageable in the short amount of time we have. To dig a hole 
<br>deep enough for a human to survive this you have to dig quite deep. No, that's not feasible." She 
<br>meant is as a joke, but apparently he missed that again. Somehow the Professor was staying quite 
<br>calm about all this. She would have thought him being a bit more anxious about the cloud of death 
<br>approaching them. When she looked at him, she saw nothing, but curiosity. Meanwhile, Aratos was 
<br>bombarded with accusations and insults from the other men, and rightly so. "What we need is 
<br>something that can shield us during the storm."
<br>"We can't build a tall lightning rod to deflect the lightnings and conduct them into the ground."
<br>"No, sadly not. But can you imagine how amazing that would be?" he grinned. "Build a makeshift 
<br>lightning rod with only the supplied found in this caravan. No, let's focus. We actually do need 
<br>something, or we are getting burned to a crisp."
<br>The crowd was getting quite angry and the shouting was annoying. It didn't help anybody if they 
<br>shouted. It also made Clair quite uncomfortable, she could taste the anger on her tongue. If there 
<br>was anything worse than a man, it was an angry man. She put the Professor between herself and the 
<br>crowd and tried to focus again, when the people parted and the nose of Calandi appeared gloriously 
<br>out of the mass of faceless strangers.
<br>"There you are", she sighed, "please you must know something, that can help us. Cy, you are our 
<br>only hope. I have to admit, we aren't prepared for something like this."
<br>"Yes, no shit you are", the Professor answered. "You had no business going on this journey and it 
<br>has become quite clear you are amateurs at best, but it's beside the point. I am thinking, but this 
<br>crowd of angry morons isn't making this any easier. Find a way to shut them up and I will think of 
<br>something."
<br>"Oh, but how am I suppose to do that?" She seemed not only frightened, but completely distraught. 
<br>She probably understood, that it was her husbands and her fault they all might die in a few hours.
<br>The Professor looked at her with that face, the face he did when he was trying to hold back so hard. 
<br>He was indeed an arrogant ass and if Clair wouldn't say anything quickly he was going to make this 
<br>a lot more uncomfortable. "Give the men something to do", letting the words stumble out of her 
<br>mouth making it up as she went along, "collect every piece of metal you have. All of their armor, 
<br>weapons and cargo. Put it in equals piles around a center point, far enough away so we can all fit in 
<br>a circle with some extra space between the piles and us. It will attract as much as the lightning as 
<br>possible and will deflect it from us."
<br>Calandi looked from Clair to the Professor and back. But he just nodded. "Alright, what else."
<br>"Put all the wagons close together so the bulls have space in the middle. Make it hard for them to 
<br>escape. They will probably get spooked when the lightnings go down near them, they normally are 
<br>inside of course."
<br>"Got it. She really is a quick thinker."
<br>Calandi quickly went towards her husband and whispered it in his ear. Aratos looked at them for a 
<br>moment, contemplating if he wanted to give this a shot. In his eyes was clear wounded pride, but 
<br>his fear was greater so he tried to get the crowd something to do. And to Clair's surprise they 
<br>listened. Even Deko started to unbuckle his sword belt.
<br>"I hope you know the piles of iron won't get us anything", the Professor said quietly.
<br>"I know that, but they don't, do they? We just need to think of something now." She looked over 
<br>towards the horizon and saw the black and white chaos rush towards them.
<br>"Sapphires!" the Professor exclaimed suddenly.
<br>"What?"
<br>"Yes, yes. It will work. We just need as many sapphires as we can get. Alright, you go around and 
<br>collect them from everybody. If they don't want to give them to you, tell them if they rather want to 
<br>die. I will get the rest done."
<br>"The rest for what?" she asked, but the Professor was already off actually running towards the 
<br>wagon they had stashed their own stuff. Mostly his stuff.
<br>Without having any more answers Clair ran over to Calandi and told her about what she needed. 
<br>"But we don't have any sapphires with us", she stuttered. "Why do you need them?"
<br>"What does it mean you don't have any? This is a trade caravan. How can you not have any 
<br>sapphires around here?"
<br>"Oh, but out here in the grasslands, sapphires are worthless, the thunderstorms won't reach much 
<br>further and so nobody wants to buy them as high a price you could get back at Shima for example."
<br>"What about the men? Some most have a few as trinkets and for good luck, won't they?"
<br>"Let's try. I will help you. But what is Cy doing with them."
<br>"Don't know, but it seems to be our only chance." She hesitated for a bit, but added: "Can you 
<br>please ask Deko for me. I want to avoid his company if possible."
<br>"Of course, darling", she said and smiled, which looked more scary than reassuring.
<br>Convincing people to give away their sapphires was easier than she first thought. Most of them 
<br>were fine after she told them it was for their survival and they would get it back and the ones who 
<br>needed a bit more persuading she told they could explain to everybody then, why they all needed to 
<br>die because of them. In sleeping thief inside her was devastated at how easy to get their sapphires. 
<br>She had worked so hard back then to get even a few gold chips.
<br>After a bit Clair and Calandi met up with the Professor, who was going through the cargo wagons 
<br>looking for something. "We got the sapphires", Clair exclaimed and he stopped, looked over to 
<br>them and climbed down.
<br>"How many?" he asked.
<br>"I got", Calandi began counting the blue stones in her bag, "five."
<br>The Professor's eyes widened in shock. "I got about ten I think", Clair stumbled, "but some of them 
<br>aren't that big to be honest. Most of them are indeed just little trinkets."
<br>The Professor put his face in his hands, "We need at the very least about thirty for the plan to work."<br></p>
