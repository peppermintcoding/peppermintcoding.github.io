            <p>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>
<br>"Stop pacing," Clair exclaimed. "You are starting to make even me nervous now." Normally, the 
<br>Professor didn't get nervous at all. There simply wasn't a situation in which he found himself 
<br>uncomfortable or not in control. And even if such a situation would arise every now and then, he 
<br>was delighted instead of being afraid or nervous. Being confronted with the unknown or mistakes 
<br>was the greatest way to learn something new, that was what the Professor picked up early in his life.
<br>But right now, standing in front of the giant double wooden doors ornamented with hundreds of 
<br>scientific discoveries telling the story of the legacy of human nature, his heart was pounding hard in
<br>his chest.
<br>"That is honestly the least of my concerns right now," he said with a much harsher overtone than he 
<br>wanted to. Was this how people felt all the time in these sort of situations? It could be an interesting 
<br>research project for the future, especially when the hearing today would fail. Well, if it failed, the 
<br>Professor was sure there wouldn't be much left to research in a year or so.
<br>"Just remember what we talked about," Clair tried again. "Don't let them provoke you. Stay calm 
<br>and present the facts. It's not much you are asking them for, but the payoff even with an error 
<br>margin for you being wrong would be enormous."
<br>"I am not wrong." And this was the problem. He rarely was, oh so rarely he could even recollect 
<br>every single time he was. But this here today, was definitely not one of them.
<br>"Don't be arrogant was on our list as well. You should really listen to my advice more often, you 
<br>know?" The Professor stopped pacing and looked down at Clair sitting on the bench in her simple 
<br>black dress and delicate black leather gloves. Because this was an official royal building all visitors 
<br>were required to affirm to the dress code given by the emperor himself. Women were restricted so 
<br>hard it was laughable.
<br>"Your little headpiece thing is croaked," he answered instead. "No man will want you if you keep 
<br>taking so little care of yourself."
<br>"If I walk into a room, no man or woman will notice the croaked headpiece next to you. Next to you
<br>I could wear a rice sack and would look better dressed than you. Please but some effort in here 
<br>before talking big. Maybe tuck your shirt?"
<br>The Professor looked down and to his surprise not only was his shirt not tucked in and messy, but 
<br>also the buttons on his jacket weren't in order. He left out two of them completely. With a scowl 
<br>towards her, he started cleaning things up a bit. Tucking the shirt in hastily and buttoning up his 
<br>jacket correctly. He almost dropped the heavy satchel on his side. It was the most important item he 
<br>had with him. Filled with all the discoveries and proofs he had for the council.
<br>"Professor, is it getting hot in here or is that because of you?" She was holding the back of her hand 
<br>at her forehead faking a faint.
<br>"There are some days I regret taking you from the streets, you know?"
<br>"No there aren't."
<br>Before he could react, the doors opened and the announcer walked out into the hallway. His golden 
<br>buttons sparkled from the lighting stones hanging from the ceiling to illuminate the hallway. His 
<br>hair was combed forward to shroud his bald spots. But he wasn't fooling anyone with it.
<br>"The Highscholars are ready for you now. Please follow me." He eyed Clair with a vile glance, "Is 
<br>she joining us in the hearing?" he asked the Professor. The Professor gave Clair an apologetic look. 
<br>He hated this, but he wasn't in a position to press the customs and Highscholars at all. He needed to 
<br>be solid, and Clair knew.
<br>"No, she won't. Shall we then?"
<br>#
<br>Without another word, the announcer turned around and walked inside. The Professor looked up 
<br>one last time at the inscription above the heavy doors. In bold gold letters stood the motto of the 
<br>whole scientific establishment: Pursuit of Truth. He has dedicated his life to the pursuit of truth and 
<br>never looked back. Everything led up to this point and now he had to do something he hated most. 
<br>Kiss the asses of people, who were far inferior to him. Sadly, he needed something from them. 
<br>Something so important every scholar was desperate to obtain. Money.
<br>When the Professor entered the room he was greeted with a wave of silence. All chatter ceased, 
<br>heads turned around to see who had entered. Like little sheep who couldn't think for themselves.
<br>"Your next candidate is Cy, Professor for Physics at the Royal University. He issued a grant for 
<br>medical research." He turned towards the Professor. "You have ten minutes to argument for your 
<br>research and answer the questions of the Highscholars."
<br>"Thank you", he said and bowed his head slightly as was custom. He walked into the middle of the 
<br>room, where light would shine through the ceiling windows onto him. The Light of Truth as they 
<br>would call it. Utter bullshit. In front of him were seven elderly men in long robes and mostly gray 
<br>and white hair. These were the Highscholars, people the Professor hated profusely. They were too 
<br>ancient to do anything useful anymore, so they were relegated to decide over money affairs. A job 
<br>for children. Behind him a crowd of other scholars, students or bureaucrats sat on benches watching
<br>the spectacle like it was some form of entertainment. It baffled him how nobody seemed to be doing
<br>any significant work around here. What a waste of resources.
<br>"I am honored to speak in front of you today", he said even though the words tasted like vile poison 
<br>in his mouth. "I have come to you with a simple, but horrifying message. A message I believe must 
<br>be heard, understood and result in action. The plague has crushed our nation and cost us almost a 
<br>third of our population. Luckily, with the antidote I found a couple of months ago we could-"
<br>"The antidote you and the council found, you mean?" The Professor bit down so hard he could hear 
<br>his teeth crunch. Highscholar Soruma. The worst leech of them all. A man so stuck up and arrogant, 
<br>he out shined even the Professor. He would do everything in his power to expose the Professor in 
<br>front of everybody here. Soruma was not only a rat, he looked like it too. Or more like a weasel? 
<br>Besides his ugly face one could always distinguish him from the other Highscholars by the giant 
<br>round lightning infused sapphire around his neck.
<br>"Yes", he said slowly. "The antidote the council and I developed. Even after that, I continued my 
<br>research into the virus that caused the plague and found something even more terrifying." The 
<br>Professor left a short pause here for dramatic effect, but he soon understood his error. Soruma 
<br>would catch onto every little pause to interrupt his speech.
<br>"So let me summarize this really quickly", Soruma began, "this is where the rest of the money went 
<br>after we found the antidote? More research of something we already know we found a working 
<br>cure? And now you come here before us begging for more money to do what exactly?" Silent 
<br>chatter behind the Professor. The sheep were eating it up. He was starting to sweat now. But this is 
<br>how they both knew it would go. This is what they planned for.
<br>"You are correct, Highscholar Soruma." Stay calm, he told himself. He had to say these words even 
<br>though they went against everything he stood for. Truth. "I spent the rest of that money to study the 
<br>virus closer, because I had a gut feeling. Something we all can agree on, is something we can't 
<br>ignore as truth-seekers." This time he earned some nods from the other Highscholars and a scowl 
<br>from Soruma. "But my findings are worth every gold piece invested. The antidote isn't perfect, it 
<br>doesn't kill the virus completely. It leaves traces of it behind, but not only that. It changes the virus 
<br>somehow. I can't say how or why this happens, but it does. Therefore I predict another outbreak is 
<br>imminent in the next half-year."
<br>The Highscholars were glancing at each other, discussing the impact of his words. They didn't seem
<br>as shocked as he thought they might be. The crowd behind him was talking furiously, but the chatter
<br>died down quickly when Soruma raised his hand to call for silence. The Professor looked at Soruma
<br>and saw a little smile on his face. His body seemed to grow heavier. What was he planning? Why 
<br>did he know? And why wasn't he concerned at all? His glance wandered over the rest of the bunch 
<br>of pretenders. All wore heavy lightning jewelry, from earrings to necklaces and rings. The bigger 
<br>the lightning infused sapphire the bigger they cocks seem to grow looking at them. The Professor 
<br>didn't wear any jewelry, but a small perfect cube sapphire around his neck. It was hidden by cloth at
<br>all time and wasn't for public display, but for himself.
<br>"Rumors, rumors, rumors", Soruma exclaimed overly theatrically. "We already know about your, 
<br>how did you call it, research." He said the word like it was an insult.
<br>The Professor felt it run cold over his shoulder. "You were spying on me?" he asked with a coarse 
<br>voice. He couldn't believe it. What did they know? He wasn't being very careful lately and made too
<br>many mistakes. Mistakes even these old geezers could find out if they only had some luck on their 
<br>side.
<br>"After the money we gave you for the antidote vanished, we had some concerns. And so as our right
<br>we looked into the matter. No need to worry though, your secrets are safe with the council of 
<br>course." A sly smile. "But what we did find out is, how your work was highly impaired when you 
<br>invited that woman into your home. We all thought it was some sort of mistress or wife you bought 
<br>yourself, but when we found out you wanted her as your apprentice, we were shocked. We all know 
<br>in thousands of years no woman had ever any significant scientific discovery or research. Woman 
<br>aren't made to be scholars. And you have the audacity to bring in street filth into our profession. You
<br>disgust-"
<br>"Shut your mouth, or I will swear to all the Gods I will ram my fist up your ass until I hit the empty 
<br>shell you call your head." The Professor was shaking now, fists clenched and shouting through his 
<br>teeth. The lightning cube around his neck was pulsating fast, it felt the rage inside him as the 
<br>lightning always does. "Clair is smarter than all of you combined even without a fancy school or 
<br>riches. You should do well not to run your mouth without knowledge." He regretted the words as 
<br>soon as they left his mouth, but there wasn't anything he could do about it. He knew it was a trap 
<br>and everything fell into place. The Professor wouldn't get out of this with any money and he knew it
<br>as soon as Soruma spoke those words. He would need to find a different way to get that money or 
<br>do it without any at all. But he would rather see the whole nation collapse and burn before giving 
<br>Soruma the satisfaction. He reseted his right hand on his satchel. It seemed the content wouldn't be 
<br>needed today.
<br>"Well, my honored colleagues", Soruma said with a winning grin, "it's clear to see now what we are 
<br>dealing with. He has lost his mind completely. How can we trust someone like you, Cy, when all 
<br>you give us is insults of our person and our whole profession and world view. You want to compare 
<br>a street whore to the council of Highscholars? What is next? She is better suited to run the country 
<br>than our Emperor? Even though it's more than you deserve I give you my thanks in the name of the 
<br>council for helping with the antidote and your name will be remember for that. But we also have to 
<br>look at the facts. I presume it was mere luck that drew you so close to the solution of the problem. 
<br>Luck is not a constant we can rely on in your studies. Therefore I want to give this up to a vote now.
<br>Is there anything to add, honored Highscholars?" Soruma looked at the others sitting on their golden
<br>asses nodding at him. They even lost their ability to think for themselves. Eating everything up 
<br>Soruma put in front of them. This wasn't a council. But the Professor was calm now. No rage, no 
<br>anxiety anymore. He knew exactly what would happen before it did. He looked towards Arth, the 
<br>oldest of the Highscholars seated at the very left edge of the table.
<br>Arth cleared his throat, "I would like to add to the thought process, that Cy's research impacted the 
<br>future of all our lives. We should not leave this out of the discussion when we decide. Therefore I 
<br>will vote for the grant, even though I find this display today despicable and highly inappropriate." 
<br>Oh dear old Arth. They call him the eagle. His thick glasses make his eyes appear bulgy. He is the 
<br>sole reason they have glasses, which can me customized to every person's own needs. A marvelous 
<br>discovery and fascinating process. He found out that with a couple of lightning sapphires and 
<br>rotation one can alter glass in all sorts of ways. The technology was forty or so years old by now 
<br>and the Professor could still remember picking up the book when he was seventeen and recreating 
<br>the process in the basement of his school. It made him smile.
<br>The Highscholars had been voting while he was dreaming about the past, but it didn't matter. Six 
<br>vetoes were crushing his hopes of getting the money he needed. The pity vote Without a bow, nod 
<br>or word, the Professor left the hall of the council. The announcer proclaimed the hearing to be over, 
<br>but he didn't hear a single word of it. Because of personal rivalries and greed, they had doomed the 
<br>whole nation.
<br>#
<br>Clair was sitting rather patiently on the little bench outside the hearing room. A group of scholars 
<br>walked by shouting her puzzled and vile glances. She could feel her blood begin to boil. Clenching 
<br>a fist she put all her rage and hate into her glance. The three men, all probably around thirty to forty 
<br>years old, avoided her eyes immediately. That was their biggest problem: on the surface they could 
<br>show their convictions against women in science, but deep down they were scared little boys with 
<br>no back bone.
<br>There was also a silver lining to this though. The warm and fuzzy feeling of hate and anger in her 
<br>belly was something Clair treasured and welcomed. It had been hard work for the last year she had 
<br>been with the Professor, that her feeling were slowly coming back to her. Of course, not all has 
<br>come back, there were still so much she was keeping bottled inside. But anger was an easy one to 
<br>remember for her. There was much to be angry about for Clair.
<br>A silent mutter crept through the cracks underneath the heavy doors. Something happened inside. 
<br>Hopefully something good. Clair was fiddling with her dress, trying to flatten her dress over and 
<br>over again. He was inside there because of her, she knew it and he knew it. If it wasn't for her, there 
<br>would have been no problem. But having a female apprentice was something the Highscholars 
<br>couldn't tolerate. Let alone an apprentice like Clair. It just had to work. They needed to say yes. 
<br>With all the evidence they meticulously collected over months of intense work they couldn't close 
<br>their eyes any longer. The plague was something far greater than this childish dispute over 
<br>formalities.
<br>Clair's thoughts were cut short when the door swung open and a stern looking Professor marched 
<br>out past her without slowing down. Quickly she jumped up from the bench and followed him 
<br>towards the exit. She could feel her stomach twisting together like a vortex. Sweat was creeping out
<br>of her pores and she felt the breakfast toying in her insides.
<br>"What happened?" she asked.
<br>"I hope that was a rhetorical question. I taught you better than that."
<br>Clair looked down to the ground frantically trying to keep up with his large steps. His cold words, 
<br>the hint of anger in his voice and indifferent posture was bringing back memories, which were 
<br>beginning to overwhelm her. She knew it was her fault, but what could she do about it?
<br>"I am sorry", she whispered.
<br>"Don't apologize for those stuck up bastards. They don't deserve any of it."
<br>"I am not apologizing for them", she said feeling the tears smearing her vision of the white marble 
<br>floor. "I know it's my fault we didn't get the grant and you have so many problems with the council 
<br>and I know it looks really bad right now, but I will find a way to get us the money for research. Or I 
<br>will find a different way of organizing us time and equipment. I just want you to know-"
<br>The Professor stopped abruptly and turned towards her. She wiped her eyes with her leather gloves 
<br>and saw him looking down at her. Next to him she always felt like a child, but almost everybody 
<br>was dwarfed by his height.
<br>"We lost the grant today because of you", he said, but his voice was warm and calm. Soruma knew 
<br>you are my weakness and he exploited it. Calling you names and trying to discredit my mental state 
<br>because I took you as an apprentice. He pressed so I pressed back."
<br>"Oh no, what did you say?"
<br>"Nothing too bad, trust me. I had myself well under control."
<br>"Sadly that doesn't mean much with you."
<br>"Well, everybody has a reputation to uphold, doesn't he?" He held out his hands and took Clair by 
<br>the shoulders. A gentle but firm grip at the same time. "You know I hate to repeat myself, but it 
<br>seems necessary with you a lot. If you hadn't come into my life, they would have found another way
<br>to discredit me and refuse the grant. Soruma and me go way back and it's not about you even 
<br>though you might like that. After all the sun doesn't revolve around you."
<br>"Neither does it revolve around the earth or so I heard someone say the other day."
<br>"What a brilliant thought. I would like to meet this mysterious person for a cup of coffee to be 
<br>honest with you."
<br>Clair could feel her body relaxing bit by bit. "Well, we shouldn't be talking about these kind of 
<br>things here. They hate us enough already we don't want to completely shatter their world view as 
<br>well, do we?" Clair smirked.
<br>The Professor smiled. "I like you way better this way, you know. Don't worry so much about these 
<br>things. You have the smartest mentor in the world, we will find a way." He started walking again.
<br>"You know I didn't worry about that so much as about.."
<br>"I know", the Professor interrupted. "It saddens me that you have so little trust in me still. I hope I 
<br>have given you zero reason to doubt my intentions, but I understand this isn't enough yet. What 
<br>would I even do without you all day? Scheme more pranks on my colleagues? Talk with my 
<br>research animals. You might not get it, but the reality is, I need you more than you need me." He 
<br>laughed. "Isn't that utterly pathetic?"
<br>Clair smiled. "Yes, we truly are." The guards opened the doors to the outside when they approached.
<br>Warm spring sun greeted them on top of the stairs leading down to the main roads. The colored 
<br>roofs seem to shine like little colorful suns. Warm reds, oranges and yellows paired with sprinkles 
<br>of blue and green. This was one of the richest districts in Shima, the capital, far away from the filthy
<br>harbors, where Clair grew up. In the distance dark clouds were forming. An imminent thunderstorm 
<br>was approaching and Clair made a mental note to record the time, intensity and duration of that 
<br>thunderstorm. It was one of the Professors favorite projects to research and it was her turn this week
<br>to record the data. Somehow he saw a pattern in the occurrence of the storms, like they weren't 
<br>natural.
<br>Walking down the steps she noticed a royal carriage at the bottom of the stairs. Only high ranked 
<br>officials of the Emperor were given the authority to use these carriages. They were made from light 
<br>birch wood, polished and embellished with carvings of mountains, trees and animals found further 
<br>north, where the Emperor and his family came from. The gold linings was reflecting the sunlight. 
<br>But Clair wasn't impressed by the artistic display of wealth, she was feeling bad for the four men, 
<br>who needed to pull the carriage up and down the hills of Shima. Horses were too expensive and 
<br>wild for such a task, even though all sorts of scholars had tried to breed better suited horses, or so 
<br>the Professor had told her once.
<br>An immaculately dressed woman was standing in front of the open carriage door. Her black hair 
<br>was combed back into a long, shiny ponytail and she watched her and the Professor with 
<br>penetrating dark eyes. The insignia of the Emperor, a white wolf, triumphantly was embroidered on 
<br>her chest.
<br>"Do you think she wants something from us?" the Professor asked with curiosity. Clair could see his
<br>eyes wander up and down. He had this weird thing for powerful women, she had noticed. Maybe 
<br>powerful was the wrong word, but demanding would do it more justice.
<br>"I don't think she would ever want anything from you. I mean look at her and then look in the 
<br>mirror for once, do you see what I mean?"
<br>She earned a scowl from the Professor, giggling into her leather gloves.
<br>"Greetings, Cy and Clair", the messenger woman exclaimed. "I am Sura Carin of the Royal 
<br>Treasury. Can you spare some time and have a chat with me?" The Royal Treasure? This has to be 
<br>about the money, which disappeared. Clair began to sweat again. Her legs felt like noodles. There 
<br>didn't seem enough air around her anymore.
<br>"So she does want something from us", the Professor said with a triumphant smile. "I guess 
<br>someone was wrong again."
<br>He looked at her knowingly. Does he not understand what this means? she thought. "Please 
<br>Professor, this seems highly inappropriate, don't you think?" Clair said and felt her cheeks blush. He
<br>felt no shame, indifferent to anyone he was speaking to. A royal messenger was not someone you 
<br>disrespected. Especially not in their position.
<br>"Apologies. We would be delighted to hear your mysterious offer." He winked at Clair.
<br>"Splendidly", Sura gestured them into the little carriage and Clair followed the Professor inside, 
<br>sitting down next to him on the perfectly white and comfy cushioned seats. The inside was quite 
<br>simple and not as pompous as the outside, but still it was screaming wealth and money. How many 
<br>days would you be able to feed a family with the money that went into this vehicle, Clair thought. 
<br>The small enclosure made her feel a bit nauseous, the air was stuffy and thick and she began to play
<br>with the folds of her dress again.
<br>"As you know, the Emperor is very concerned about the plague and its repercussions on the capital 
<br>and whole nation. He isn't taking this as lightly as some other people."
<br>"You mean the council of Highscholars, perhaps?" the Professor asked. Why can't he just shut up 
<br>and not make her angry before anything has started? Her heart was pounding fast and her fingers 
<br>were slippery.
<br>Sura looked at the Professor for a moment and folded her hands on top of her thighs, "You might be
<br>accustomed to talking over woman in your profession, Professor, but as I can assume you being 
<br>above average intelligence you know how to treat a member of the royal court. I suggest you 
<br>remember what you learned and not behave like a little child in front of a person, who is still willing
<br>to help you. Did I make myself clear?" So composed, so clear. She reminded Clair weirdly enough 
<br>of the Professor himself.
<br>The Professor looked taken aback, "I meant no disrespect with my interruption. It will not happen 
<br>again, I will assure you, Sura Carin." He bowed his head slightly. This wasn't like him at all. What 
<br>is going on? The fact that she didn't understand anything was making her even more nervous. The 
<br>Professor on the other hand was oozing out confidence and calmness.
<br>"So, we are interested in making your research project a reality. We are concerned, even if some 
<br>have spoken against, that your research might have some valid reasoning and we are looking at 
<br>another outbreak. Therefore the Royal Treasure is offering you a somewhat different option than a 
<br>normal grant. Are you following?"
<br>Clair was nodding even though she knew Sura was barely talking at her. She was there because it 
<br>would have been impolite to not invite her inside the carriage as well. But this woman demanded a 
<br>reaction.
<br>"Do you allow me a quick question?" the Professor inquired.
<br>Sura nodded, but her eyebrows went up. Don't push her, Clair begged. "Why do you offer me even 
<br>more money for my research? Don't you think the grant from the council is enough?"
<br>Sura's face stayed a perfect mask, but her eyes gave out a hint of fear. Clair grew more and more 
<br>interested in what the Professor had in mind. This wasn't going in the direction she thought it would
<br>go.
<br>Sura opened her mouth, but nothing came out. Silence covered the carriage. Clair didn't dare to look
<br>towards the Professor, but had her eyes glued on the royal messenger. "I was under the impression 
<br>the grant was denied for you", she finally said.
<br>"Yes, we were heartbroken when the judgment was called, weren't we Clair?" He gave no time for a
<br>response. "But I guess something is quite puzzling for me. Maybe you can spread some light on the 
<br>matter at hand: how does a royal messenger know the outcome of a council hearing before it was 
<br>concluded? I mean I didn't see anybody race me to the exit doors informing you of the outcome, did
<br>you Clair?" Again, no pause. "And then there is the problem of you already being here waiting for 
<br>us. It seems to me rather strange. Can you help me out with this little puzzle?"
<br>Clair began to understand. But still, it didn't make any sense. Somehow the Professor knew the 
<br>answer already.
<br>The messenger woman tried to escape his eyes, but the pause made her even more uncomfortable. 
<br>"I normally don't get into these sort of situations, I have to apologize for my lack of 
<br>professionalism. You are correct, I knew the outcome before the hearing had taken place."
<br>"Unsurprising really. So what is this different option, as you put it."
<br>"Alright", Sura began finding her composure again, "we are under the impression for the highest 
<br>chance of success we need to diversify our research options. Not only will we fund projects in all 
<br>five kingdoms, but also outside. You are in the unique position, that you have no backing of the 
<br>council or any of your colleagues for that matter. You won't be much use of us here, if you can't 
<br>work with other scholars. But there is another branch we like to follow."
<br>"Enlighten us, please."
<br>"The Maru grasslands have a broad and diverse plant life. We have very little data on any of their 
<br>medicinal capacities and with the new virus we need to look into all option-"
<br>She was interrupted by loud laughter from the Professor. It wasn't even his fake laughter to annoy or
<br>belittle, he was actually amused. Whenever he was enjoying himself he would laugh with an open 
<br>mouth and show much of his teeth, but also he would be aware of that and trying to hide his big 
<br>mouth with his palm.
<br>"What do you think, Clair", he said after he calmed down a bit, "would you like to travel the 
<br>grasslands to study some plants? Does that sound like a great time to you? What could go wrong, 
<br>right?"
<br>"I have to admit", Clair said trying to sound as confident as the Professor, "it sounds not only stupid 
<br>but reckless. Who came up with this ridiculous plan?"
<br>"It doesn't matter you came up with it. What matters is the future. And I include your own future 
<br>here as well." Something in her tone did scare Clair. "I want to be honest with you, especially after 
<br>seeing you are not easily fooled. This is not really an offer than an order. I don't want to waste my 
<br>or your time any longer."
<br>"What happens if I refuse?" the Professor asked now without any emotion. "I have a job and other 
<br>research avenues to follow. Why would I endanger my life with this project?"
<br>"There has been rising pressure from the council to remove you from the royal university. The 
<br>students seem to have found a liking towards you and their parents are inclined to keep you in your 
<br>current position. But they aren't as powerful as they once were. Your support is dwindling and with 
<br>some intervention from higher up.. We of course don't want to go there. It would be bad for both 
<br>sides, but as you might see it would be fatal for you." No, this was impossible.
<br>"You can't do that", Clair said ignoring the knot in her stomach telling her to keep quiet.
<br>"It's alright, Clair. Let her speak."
<br>"You will have a week to make arrangements and will leave with a trade caravan making a round 
<br>trip through the grasslands. You will be disguised as merchants interested in new herbs and 
<br>medicine. Try to make contact with healers of the different tribes and learn as much as possible."
<br>"When will I be allowed to return?" The question made her heart freeze.
<br>"As soon as you find a promising candidate or when the half-year prognosis of yours ends. After 
<br>that we will have certainty either way."
<br>"Was that all then?"
<br>The messenger nodded. "You may leave now."
<br>The Professor left the carriage quickly and Clair followed. As soon as the door closed behind them, 
<br>the carriage went off into the distance. The warm sun couldn't shake the shiver Clair felt through her
<br>whole body.
<br>"They can't do this, can they?" she asked.
<br>"Don't embarrass yourself and think before you speak. It is all very clear."
<br>"It is clear?" She was getting angry now. "How can you say this. They want to ship you off into the 
<br>grasslands and you will just stand there and take it? I need you here." The tears were starting again.
<br>"I have no choice, but to follow. But you have a choice, Clair. You have a week to decide."
<br>"You know how I am going to decide. I can't leave San behind. I am all he has got left."
<br>He lay his hand on her shoulder, gentle but firm. "I know."
<br>Nothing more needed to be said. The man he thought of as her father was leaving her. And again 
<br>she was powerless. She didn't feel sad, all she felt was rage.<br></p>
