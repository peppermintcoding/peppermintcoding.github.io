            <p>Chapter 6
<br>
<br>
<br>"I do miss the fighting", the Emperor said. "Not the war, not the slaughter of men, but the simple 
<br>and incomparable feeling you get when the lightning is running through your veins. This feeling of 
<br>power, of life. I don't know anything that makes you feel quite like it."
<br>"No, there really isn't", his brother, Haru, said. Su was standing a bit to the side watching over the 
<br>sparring grounds below. The arena was big enough to host multiple thousands of people, but today 
<br>they were only a small group to watch some of the members of the Royal Academy spar. Four 
<br>guards, two servants, who were constantly bringing refreshments and little bits to eat, Su himself 
<br>and the two brothers.
<br>"A great hit", the Emperor exclaimed hitting the armrest with his fist. He was wearing a rather 
<br>boring military inspired uniform like he always did. Of course, it was way more sophisticated and 
<br>ornamented than normal uniforms of generals, but the lack of anything original was disappointing. 
<br>A few sapphire buttons here and there sparkling and crackling or the golden family crest, a growling
<br>wolf head, was everything that really distinguished him from a random general. Even his hairstyle 
<br>was nothing special, short all around. How could you waste the freedom and money you get as an 
<br>Emperor and not do something more forward with your clothing? It was beyond Su's understanding.
<br>"Brother", Haru began, "we aren't here to watch the sparring, are we?"
<br>The Emperor stoically watched the pairing below. Kurana seemed to have the upper hand, but she 
<br>wasn't conserving any of her lightning charge so it wasn't yet decided. The crackling was audible 
<br>even so far away and the occasional rumble of thunder washed over them when the two Charged 
<br>exchanged powerful blows. "Su, tell me, what is our biggest problem right now?"
<br>"In what regards, my Emperor?"
<br>"In regards to the whole nation of course. If you look at the complete picture here."
<br>Su thought about it for a moment, he didn't want to disappoint Haru with a thoughtless answer. "I 
<br>suppose our biggest problem is the repercussions of the plague. Because the birds were a vital 
<br>carrier of the virus a lot of farmers were infected from the birds seeking shelter from thunderstorms 
<br>in their barns and so on. We will be facing quite a shortage of food if we can't cultivate our fields." 
<br>He had kept his voice even and without shaking this time. Even after years of being in the company 
<br>of the two brothers, it was still making him nervous.
<br>Haru nodded slowly and the Emperor said, "You taught him well brother. Keep it up boy and you 
<br>will surpass us old guys in no time."
<br>"I would never dream of-"
<br>"Yes, yes", the Emperor waved his hand at nothing. "I know of your convictions, but save them for 
<br>someone who wants to hear them. I have had people swear on their family's lives they wouldn't 
<br>betray us, but those bastards did so anyways. Words are nothing than empty shells, actions are the 
<br>only truth. And that's what we have to do, take action."
<br>"We are already taking action", Haru said taking a rice ball with a meat filling. "Our soldiers are 
<br>moving out and working the fields before the population recovers. Wasn't that your genius plan just 
<br>a few months ago." It weakens us though, Su thought but didn't want to speak the words out loud.
<br>"A great idea in a perfect world, brother. Sadly enough, our world is far from perfect. I know you 
<br>aren't interested in politics and that's fine, but I need you to understand the seriousness of our 
<br>situation. We are losing power and we are losing it fast."
<br>"What do you mean?" Haru asked with a full mouth. "Nobody would dare to stand against us, not 
<br>after the War of Unity. We still have the biggest army and the most talented Charged. How are we in
<br>any danger?"
<br>"I have to apologize Su. Apparently my brother isn't fit to be a teacher at all. Our army is barely 
<br>enough to fend off two of the four kingdoms. The North is still loyal to us and that won't change 
<br>any time soon. The rest is another thing entirely. We gave them too much freedom. A tax break here,
<br>more control over a certain trade and and and. Now our treasury is running dry."
<br>"You say we, but I didn't sign off on these laws. I would have gone to war like we should have done
<br>back then. You can buy their loyalty, you have to take it by force."
<br>"And put the nation through another war? No, not if I can prevent it."
<br>"Apparently you couldn't. You have just postponed the inevitable."
<br>The Emperor sighed. Suddenly everybody turned their attention to the entrance. Little high pitched 
<br>bells sounded through the hallway leading to their lounge. Out of the shadows emerged a tall 
<br>woman with long, braided hair. Su was always struck by her appearance. Even the Gods must envy 
<br>her beauty, he was sure of it. It wasn't only her obvious beauty, but also the way she demanded the 
<br>attention of a whole room as soon as she was walking in. She was wearing a dark blue dress with 
<br>impeccable seams and embroidered flowers in a thin gold yarn. Her shoulders were left uncovered 
<br>and the dress went over into a loop around her flawless, long neck. She wore a deep red lipstick and
<br>blue eyeshadow matching the dress perfectly. Around her ankles were the little bells she always 
<br>wore without fail. He still didn't understand quite why. Small charged sapphire earrings were the 
<br>only jewelry she wore to round out the composition.
<br>"I hope I haven't come too late", the Empress said with a voice that left goosebumps on Su's skin. 
<br>She glided over to the empty seat next to the Emperor. Haru was staring a little too long at her 
<br>walking through the room, the guards knew better than to stare, but the Emperor's brother wasn't 
<br>subject to these normal rules.
<br>"No my dear, I was just trying to explain the situation to my brother", the Emperor answered, leaned
<br>over and kissed her on the cheek, "but he seems to not get the point yet."
<br>"Well, not very surprising I suppose, is it?"
<br>"It's always nice to have you around, Ridani", Haru answered dryly. "I hoped you were still busy 
<br>ordering around the servants to fetch you another dress."
<br>The Empress ignored the spiteful tone of Haru and looked over to Su, who in turn began to turn red.
<br>"It seems the fight is already over", she exclaimed disappointed. "I was looking forward to see a 
<br>good sparring match. It has been quite some time. Su, why don't you show us what it means to be 
<br>Haru's prodigy? I would love to see what progress you have made since I last saw you."
<br>"I doubt Kurana or Liu would be satisfying opponents for him", Haru said. Was there a little pride in
<br>his voice?
<br>"What about a two against one sparring match then?" the Emperor said.
<br>Ridani seemed delighted. "Forgive us, Su", she said, "but you really don't have a choice in this, 
<br>because I got you a little present. And you can only wear it in a fight. Your garments always look so 
<br>fashionable, it pains me to see you fight with these bland beige vests all the time." She clapped 
<br>twice with her hands and a servant appeared in the doorway.
<br>"A present for me, Empress?" Su exclaimed shocked. Did she just make him a compliment for his 
<br>style? A warm feeling expanded in his stomach giving him the feeling of being half the weight he 
<br>actually was a second ago. It felt like floating, blood rushing to his face. "I don't think I can accept a
<br>gift from you." He bowed deeply.
<br>"Do you want to deny me this simple pleasure of making you a small present?" she asked outraged, 
<br>but then smiled quickly again. "Please, just try it on once. Karon, would you be so kind and inform 
<br>Kurana and Liu they should prepare to fight Su." Karon, commander of the guards, bowed and went
<br>down the stairs.
<br>The servant brought over the present to Su. It was packaged in black satin with a red ribbon around 
<br>it. He slowly pulled the ribbon off and unraveled the satin. Underneath a sparring vest appeared. 
<br>But it wasn't in the normal bland beige color, no, it had a rich blue color, the Empress favorite, with 
<br>purple pockets for the charged sapphires. It probably didn't meet the taste of most people, especially
<br>Charged, but for Su it was gorgeous. He had been begging Haru to let him wear a different outfit for
<br>sparring was always shut down again and again. Tradition was important to him, and he though 
<br>color would simply distract from the duel. Not that it made much sense, because if you were 
<br>distracted from a bit of color, how could you fare well in a real battle with so many things going on?
<br>Also, the lightning cloak was tinting the outfit underneath even more.
<br>But this was really bad. What was he to do now? He couldn't not take the present, it was from the 
<br>Empress herself of course. Then again, taking it would mean taking sides against Haru. The joy he 
<br>felt tipped over and he started sweating.
<br>"Ridani", Haru exclaimed with repressed anger in his voice and made Su jump a bit, "you know 
<br>quite well, why I have forbid him from using anything else than the traditional garments for a duel. 
<br>We all know why you did this."
<br>"Excuse me", she answered as calm as a puddle after a storm, "but I made Su a present because I 
<br>feel he deserves it. What is all this power we have proclaimed, if we don't use it to make the world a
<br>little bit more beautiful. It's just a vest, Haru. What's the big deal?"
<br>"The big deal is, that you did it to spite me. The worst part is, that you have put him in a horrible 
<br>position. Whom will he listen to now? His teacher or the Empress? He can't say no to either one."
<br>"It was never my intention to any such a thing. I was simply trying to make him feel welcome to the
<br>family and with that comes some special perks. Like not being subject to any dress code, even if it 
<br>is in the holy duel arena."
<br>Haru grunted and the Emperor breathed out deep, "Can you two get along for once?" Su wanted to 
<br>say something, but his tongue felt like sand in his mouth, no way to actually make a sound.
<br>Luckily, in that moment, Karon appeared again, "Emperor, Empress, the two opponents are ready 
<br>and waiting for Su."
<br>The Empress thanked him and looked at Haru.
<br>"Master?" Su cawed. Hopefully all this sweating wasn't going to ruin his shirt. It was made by his 
<br>new tailor.
<br>"Go ahead and take the fucking vest", Haru finally said. "I guess the Empress is right, it's just a vest.
<br>I hope though, that you won't take other rules and principles with the same leisure." Su could hear 
<br>the teeth gnashing with every word. This would have repercussions.
<br>"Thank you, Master", he said, taking the vest and going down to the arena. When he left through the
<br>doorway he winced, when Haru and the Empress started arguing intensely.
<br>#
<br>Waking into the arena the sand felt soft underneath Su's feet. Two servants had filled every pocket 
<br>of his vest with fully charged sapphires. A talented Charged could fight with a vest like this for 
<br>about an hour on full power, but he didn't expect the fight to go that long. Light streamed in through
<br>the glass dome overhead of Su. The thunderstorm had just left, waltzing towards the west before 
<br>finally becoming a mere drizzle.
<br>"There he is", Kurana said with her sly smile. Both her and Liu wore the traditional beige vest, so 
<br>basic.
<br>"So is this going to be a two against one?" Liu asked.
<br>"Yes it is." Su made some warm up movements. Even though the lightning was giving the body 
<br>extraordinary power, the baseline for everything was your own physical muscles and joints. If you 
<br>weren't in top shape, all of the power couldn't be used in an optimal way.
<br>"Nice vest by the way", Liu said, "I guess it has its perks to be kissing the asses of the royal family, 
<br>doesn't it."
<br>Su shot her a vile glare, but didn't say anything. She was clearly jealous.
<br>"How about we make this a little bit more interesting than just sparring it out?" Kurana asked trying
<br>to change the topic and avoid further insults.
<br>"And what are you thinking about?" he asked, but knew the answer already. She had been plaguing 
<br>him to go on a date for weeks now.
<br>"If we win, Kurana has a wish free from you", Liu said when she saw Kurana was hesitating. If Su 
<br>had the choice he would rather go out with Liu, not that he actually would though. At least she was 
<br>putting in some effort with how she dressed. Now, she was wearing the boring training clothes, but 
<br>normally she also didn't always adhere to the strict fashion rules everybody else was following like 
<br>Kurana.
<br>"And what will I get if I win?" he asked instead of engaging further. He stretched his arms and legs, 
<br>bending down touching his ankles.
<br>"You get to choose both our outfits for the next ball", Kurana said.
<br>Su jumped up from his stretch suddenly feeling way more excited. "I get to choose the outfit, 
<br>makeup and accessories?"
<br>"Everything", Kurana laughed. "You know, you might be the only guy in this world, who would be 
<br>excited because of something like that."
<br>"We can't be all unique, can we Kurana?" This was actually getting more interesting now. He 
<br>especially had so many ideas for Kurana to finally show her how much she could do if she only put 
<br>in some effort. Her body lent itself to a form fitting dress, or even a combination of pants and 
<br>something else. So many possibilities.
<br>"I accept", he said. "What are the rules?"
<br>"No weapons", Liu said, "you are out when you are outside the inner ring or you give up 
<br>voluntarily."
<br>"That won't happen."
<br>"Let's see about that", Kurana said and her lightning cloak formed around her. The familiar 
<br>crackling filled the air and her eyes turned to white. Everything on her body defied the the ground 
<br>and moved like she was submerged in water. Her hair flowing as if wind was softly blowing on 
<br>them with every movement she did. Liu followed her lead, hands meeting in front of her chest and 
<br>the crackling cloak formed around her, hugging her body perfectly. Her aura was a bit brighter than 
<br>Kurana's, meaning she was able to use the sapphires a bit better.
<br>Su breathed in deep and put his hands together in front of his heart. He opened himself up to the 
<br>outside and felt the sapphires in his vest start to tingle and vibrate slightly. It was almost like they 
<br>were crying out to be used and the lightning to be released from inside. When the lightning entered 
<br>his body, it felt like a cold liquid running through every vein. His head cleared up and his whole 
<br>body felt light as a feather.
<br>He entered water stance, a stance fitted best for quick dodges and light attacks. He first needed to 
<br>feel out his opponents and see how they would react to certain attack patterns. Fighting a charged 
<br>was all about timing and openings. The cloak made direct injuries impossible without a weapon, but
<br>the impact from a well placed punch to the chest could make you go flying dozens of meters 
<br>through the air. And that was his plan.
<br>Liu and Kurana wasn't going to give him the opportunity though and dashed towards him with 
<br>superhuman speed. Their attacks were slightly staggered so he dodged Kurana's fist going for his 
<br>chest first by dodging to the left and then jumped with a backward somersault over Liu's kick 
<br>towards his legs. The key to fighting was not to ever stand still and give the other person time to 
<br>form a precise attack plan. So he dashed towards Liu trying to land a low blow against her side. She
<br>blocked and retaliated with a series of quick punches. Su blocked them all with one hand while 
<br>using the other to block the incoming attack from behind. Kurana tried to sneak behind, but wasn't 
<br>quick enough to surprise him. Fighting was exhilarating even after all these years. The 
<br>weightlessness he felt was incomparable to anything else, he jumped higher than normally possible 
<br>making it seem like he could fly.
<br>Whenever a blow was blocked a little rumble of thunder was released, like a angry animal getting 
<br>restless to overwhelm its prey. To Su fighting another Charged was more like a dance than a fight. It
<br>was about quick exchanged and fluid motion. The lightning made it possible to move almost twice 
<br>as fast as normal humans and every blow was strong enough to shatter stone pillars. Fighting two 
<br>enemies was normally quite unfair, but Su was playing in a different league than the two girls. 
<br>Somehow the Gods favored some over the others and gave them greater ability to use the lightning 
<br>power. Nonetheless he needed the fight to end quickly, being faster and stronger than them wouldn't
<br>protect him from making mistakes.
<br>The next hit from Kurana he blocked with dodging close to her body, his cloak brushing hers and 
<br>releasing a loud crackling sound. He then pushed his shoulder against her chest with a satisfying 
<br>rumble and made Kurana fly through the air and land in the sand a dozen or so meter away from 
<br>him. A big cloud of sand shrouded her before him. She was close to the line, but not over it, he was 
<br>sure of it. But it would give him one or two seconds, enough to get rid of Liu.
<br>Liu tried to use the opening to swipe his feet from under him and topple him over, a perfect trap was
<br>unraveling. He dodged the kick with a high jump, normally an amateur move and Liu thought so 
<br>too because she was smiling seeing him rise in the air. Instead of waiting for the arch to send him 
<br>back to the ground, Su held out his right hand towards the ceiling of the domed arena and 
<br>discharged a large quantity of lightning through his hand. He had to stabilize his hand with all the 
<br>strength he could muster up when he felt the recoil. He immediately felt two sapphires lose their 
<br>charge and stop vibrating in his chest, but this move was worth the cost. Liu was caught of guard 
<br>when Su was catapulted towards the ground with an immense velocity instead of following the slow
<br>arch he had predicted and wanted to take advantage of. He had trained this move so often with 
<br>Haru, the time was impeccable. The discharge shot his hand right against Liu's head and punched 
<br>her into the ground. A shock wave of air and sand spread from the blow accompanied by a deep 
<br>growl of thunder. He didn't skip a single of his fastened heartbeats, grabbed her by the legs, feeling 
<br>her lightning cloak tingle his hands and not allowing him to touch her actual skin. With one fluid 
<br>spinning motion he flung the stunned Liu around once and released her making the poor girl soar 
<br>through the air towards the elimination line.
<br>One down, he though and making himself ready to block the incoming attack of Kurana, but she 
<br>wasn't coming at him at all. Instead he watched her whiz through half the arena, intercepting the 
<br>flying Liu, grabbing her leg and spinning her around to slow down her velocity. They were rotating 
<br>so fast, a normal person would have ripped apart probably or lost track of where they were, even 
<br>with lightning running through your veins it was impressive. Kurana released Liu shooting her right
<br>towards him. He just saw her topple over the line before Liu crashed into him. There was no time to
<br>dodge her, so he tried to block with another discharge of lightning, reducing his sapphire charges by
<br>another complete three. Another rumble of thunder crashed through the arena. Even so, the first 
<br>punch from Liu's fist cracked his forearm for blocking a powerful direct hit like this with an audible
<br>sound. She then followed it up with a spinning kick towards his chest, catapulting him away from 
<br>her towards the elimination line. Su tried to grab hold of anything, but there was only sand he 
<br>couldn't hold on to. He looked behind him and saw the red line approach quickly, giving him little 
<br>time to react. He had not enough to use another discharge, because it would leave him with not 
<br>enough lightning charge to continue fighting so he would lose anyways. Instead he pooled his cloak
<br>into his still intact left forearm and hand, thrusting them into the ground. The lightning cloak cut 
<br>through the ground like it was nothing turning the sand to glass in an instant. The screeching sound 
<br>was horrible cutting through all that newly formed glass, but it gave him enough resistance to stop 
<br>just shy of the ominous line. He couldn't lose, not only wanted he his price, but he also really, really
<br>didn't want to give Kurana a personal wish.
<br>When he finally stopped, he stood up straight and saw Liu watch him intently. She also suffered 
<br>some injury from the punch waiting for the lightning to heal the bones. It was a weird how the bone 
<br>regrew inside his arm. By now he was accustomed to it, every strong punch would leave you with 
<br>broken bones, but they always healed quickly. Only the pain was irritating. Not right now, while the
<br>cloak protected him, but after wards it would hurt and swell a little.
<br>"Nice move", Liu said with her distorted voice.
<br>"You too, I didn't expect that kind of teamwork from you two. But it's time to finish this." He put his
<br>hands in front of his chest again, preparing for the second stage when Liu's cloak disappeared and 
<br>she held up her hand.
<br>"I give up", she said, put her hands before her chest and bowed a little. Su did the same, ending the 
<br>sparring duel and releasing his cloak. He immediately felt pain shooting through his right forearm. 
<br>He would need to get some sort of ointment from the doctors.
<br>Kurana came running, supporting Liu who had trouble putting weight on the leg she used to kick Su
<br>out of the ring. "Well", Kurana said quietly, "I guess you will be putting us in embarrassing clothes 
<br>then."
<br>"On the contrary", he answered, "it will be the first time you won't embarrass yourself at the dance. 
<br>You will see, nobody will be able to take their eyes off of you." The words turned her head red and 
<br>he regretted saying the words. She probably hoped he would be one of the people. "Well, I will be 
<br>going then", he said quickly. "There is still some business to be discussed and I would like to catch 
<br>the end of the conversation."
<br>"Is something happening?" Kurana asked.
<br>"I will tell you if I know something for sure."
<br>#
<br>Returning to the lounge Su was greeted by applause from everybody. "What a splendid fight", the 
<br>Empress proclaimed enthusiastically. "I hope the vest was up to your normal standards?" Su 
<br>nodded. Even Haru acknowledged his well used discharges during the match, a move he invented 
<br>himself.
<br>"Fetch a doctor quickly, the Emperor ordered one of the guards. "Sit down, Su, we have still some 
<br>important things to discuss and I want you to be part of the discussion."
<br>"Listen closely, Haru", Ridani said with a disarming smile. "It would be a shame if we need to 
<br>repeat ourselves again and again."
<br>"Anyways, where were we?" the Emperor said ignoring the cold air around. "Yes, we need to 
<br>strengthen our position. We need to get our soldiers out of the fields again so nobody is getting any 
<br>ideas while we are weakened. And we also need to weaken the armies of the four kings themselves. 
<br>They have been growing rapidly, not only in numbers of normal soldiers, but in equipment and 
<br>training experience."
<br>"What do you think we should do, Su?" the Empress asked suddenly.
<br>Su felt his mouth dry up completely. She asked him a direct question. Calm down or you will 
<br>embarrass yourself, he thought. "I am sorry, Empress, but I am not sure there is a solution to this 
<br>problem. I doubt we can get any of the kings to use their own soldiers to cultivate the lands after the
<br>Emperor had already agreed to do so himself. And we can't just create thousands of people, who 
<br>would be able to relieve our soldiers, from nothing, can we?"
<br>Ridani smiled amused, "We actually can, with some ingenuity of course."
<br>"Please enlighten us with your world saving plan", Haru said taking another rice ball and biting 
<br>down on it.
<br>She ignore the spite in his voice like a true empress, "You might be in a grumpy mood now, but I 
<br>am sure you won't be after you hear what I have to say. We have been planning something nobody 
<br>has dared in hundreds of years. We are going to invade the grasslands."
<br>Haru began choking on his rice ball, spitting it out onto the floor. A servant hurried quickly to clean 
<br>it up before the last piece had fallen to the ground. Then Haru continued laughing. "And how will 
<br>that solve any of our problems? There is nothing out there Ridani, if you have forgotten already. We
<br>don't need more land to feed our people, so what are we looking for out there?"
<br>"We are looking for the people themselves", the Emperor said.
<br>"Wait, wait", Haru said gesturing heavily with his hands. "You can't be serious, can you? You want 
<br>them as slaves?" Su was as confused as Haru was. The empire was built upon certain laws, which 
<br>couldn't be changed, not even by the emperor himself. And the outlawing of slavery was one of the 
<br>cornerstones the empire was built upon. "Brother, you of all the people wouldn't dare to change 
<br>these laws, would you? This isn't what father died for."
<br>"We are not going to change any of the laws, we are also not going to break any of these laws", the 
<br>Empress interrupted. "We are going to make use of the exact words, the laws have been written 
<br>down."
<br>"No citizen of the empire shall be property to another citizen", Su recited.
<br>"Exactly", the Emperor said, "but the nomads of the grasslands aren't citizens of the empire and will
<br>never be citizens. So they aren't subject to our laws at all. Don't you see the opportunity we have 
<br>found here, brother?"
<br>"I always thought you were the smarter one of us, brother. But this plan of yours is a fools one. Let's
<br>ignore the fact how the population will react to basically reinstating slavery, even if it's not with our 
<br>own people. But of all the times we could have tried invading the grasslands, you are picking the 
<br>worst of times. The four kings aren't as obedient as we want them to be and starting a war will be an
<br>opportunity if nothing else for them. And also what about the grasslands? Have you forgotten how 
<br>they went completely dark in the last months? No merchant, who has any desire to live or see his 
<br>wares sold is making trips around anymore, our spies are all disappearing before they can send back
<br>any information. Something strange is going on out there and we have no idea about any of it. And 
<br>you want to invade them now, without any preparation?" Haru had clenched his fists and was 
<br>getting quite angry.
<br>"So what will you have us do?" the Empress asked not faced by his anger one bit. How is it possible
<br>for her to stay this calm? Su thought. He was getting antsy just sitting in the vicinity of him. Would 
<br>his anger be projected on him he would turn into a pile of dust and try to disappear in the cracks of 
<br>the floor.
<br>"I thought you would relish the idea for a good fight", his brother said. "This is the only opportunity
<br>I can give you in your lifetime probably. I won't see another war happen that divides this nation. But
<br>this war has the possibility to stabilize this land. We don't have many other options. Either it's this or
<br>we will see our people starve. What do you think they will do then?"
<br>Silence fell like a heavy blanket on top of everybody. Su wasn't sure if there was anything he could 
<br>say in this situation. He didn't know if the Emperor was right with his assessment, but he probably 
<br>was. One of the arena's doctors came into the room, relinquishing the silence for a moment. He 
<br>bowed low and treated Su's wounded arm. Everybody was waiting for an answer from Haru. He 
<br>was after all the commander of the royal army and their strongest warrior. Without him the 
<br>endeavor was sure to fail.
<br>"What if we fail to bring back any slaves?"
<br>"We won't fail."
<br>"You can't be serious brother.."
<br>"Do you actually think I would consider this plan if there was another option?" the Emperor said. 
<br>He was just as calm as his wife. They were quite sure of the outcome of the conversation. They 
<br>must be having some form of information still holding back, that will bring this all together.
<br>"What about the charged sapphires?" Su asked, immediately taking a sip of wine when he felt his 
<br>mouth to be dry as sand again.
<br>"I was thinking the same thing", Haru said. "Our powers are useless out there. We can't preserve the 
<br>lightning for more than a few weeks in sapphires and beyond the border there are no storms 
<br>anymore. They will simply see us coming and ride away. We aren't fast enough without Charged 
<br>cutting off their retreat and forcing them to fight."
<br>"The council has been working on something special", Ridana began, "for especially this kind of 
<br>purpose. I think it was Soruma, who lead this research making it possible for sapphires to contain 
<br>their charged for months, if not years. He couldn't test it thoroughly yet, because it is a fairly new 
<br>discovery. We have thought about this plan extensively, Haru. We haven't pulled this from nothing 
<br>just before today. We have been working on it for months now."
<br>"So, I would actually get to fight for real again?" Haru asked.
<br>"The white flame will burn again, brighter than ever before and lead us out of this darkness", the 
<br>Emperor exclaimed loudly.
<br>"Too dramatic, sweetheart", Ridani said, but Ru could see the light in Haru's eyes. He wanted to 
<br>burn again for so long and they finally gave him a reason to do so. This meant war, and Su would be
<br>on the front lines if he wanted or not.<br></p>
