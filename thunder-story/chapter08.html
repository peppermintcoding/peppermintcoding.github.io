<br>
<br>"What do you mean thirty?" Clair asked thunderstruck. The Professor was walking up and down 
<br>trying to think of something. He was talking with himself like he always did.
<br>"Oh, maybe I can find some more", Calandi said. "There must be some more somewhere." She left 
<br>the bag on the ground and fled. The dark clouds were coming dangerously close. White lightning 
<br>and deep thunder. Even the air felt already charged.
<br>"What was your plan anyway?" Clair asked the Professor.
<br>"Doesn't really matter, does it now? I was experimenting with sapphires a couple of years ago, but 
<br>put it on ice because it was boring me. I wanted to get closer to the nature of the lighting, but all I 
<br>found was a way to extend the lifespan of a charged sapphire. Useful, but not very interesting, so I 
<br>left it behind. But we could have used some of the techniques to create a shield above us. Sapphire 
<br>attract lightning like nothing else, so if we had enough of them we could make a grid above our 
<br>heads and hope they are enough to redirect all the lightning away from us. But with so few, there is 
<br>no way we can protect everybody, especially not the animals. I am quite afraid to see what will 
<br>happen if the others hear of that, that there is only a small safe space for all of us. I don't think it 
<br>will be a healthy in environment to be in."
<br>Clair was thinking, but nothing quite made sense. She wasn't well versed in lightning theories and 
<br>she wasn't an engineer. If she was honest, she wasn't anything at all. She had some separate talents 
<br>here and there, but nothing really useful. "So, we need to create a shield above us with about fifteen 
<br>sapphire to redirect the lightning away from us. What if we could move the sapphires around? 
<br>Would that cover more area then?"
<br>The Professor stopped, "It might. But how are you gonna move them? They would have to be 
<br>moving quite fast to have the effect we want. Nothing we can do with our weak bodies." And he 
<br>started pacing again.
<br>"How about human sacrifice? Maybe the Gods will be pleased with us then and let us survive."
<br>"If the Gods actually cared about any of us, they wouldn't send us plagues, which kill a third of the 
<br>population, would they?"
<br>No time for bad jokes then. "Cy?" she asked slowly. He stopped in his tracks again and looked at 
<br>her confused. "Are we going to die?" It was a simple question. She wasn't particularly anxious 
<br>about it, she often had wished it to happen actually. Now that it was imminent it felt different, but 
<br>she was mostly concerned about the Professor and a little about Calandi as well. There were 
<br>probably more good hearted people in this group she didn't even know of. They didn't want to die 
<br>and they didn't deserve to die.
<br>"Clair", he said slowly with a warm smile, "I promise you, we will not die here. You haven't fought 
<br>your way through the life you had and end up dead by a thunderstorm out in no-mans-land. Our 
<br>story won't end here, it has just began. I mean who else is gonna save the nation from a civilization 
<br>killing plague?"
<br>"How can you be this optimistic in our situation? I can see you are struggling to get an answer to 
<br>our problem, because there really is nothing we can do anymore. How can you promise something 
<br>like this? Empty promises are worse than the truth. Just say it out loud, that we are going to die out 
<br>here and don't give me some heartwarming promise, we both now is just crap. You can't do anything
<br>about this storm."
<br>"That's precisely where you are wrong, there is always something you can do. It's especially in these
<br>moments, when it seems impossible, we become something greater. The void won't beat you just 
<br>because it sucks you in. It..", he trailed off.
<br>"It's not like you to get that philosophical or even stop mid lecture. Please tell me, you are having a 
<br>stroke because your words make me want to vomit."
<br>"Negative charge", he exclaimed ignoring Clair completely. "So simple, so elegant. Don't you see?"
<br>"I see how imminent death is making you even more self centered."
<br>"I listened to every word you said, but none of them deserve any answer, so I won't bother. You can 
<br>keep talking shit at me or help me so we can stick it to Soruma in the end."
<br>Clair breathed in deep, "So what is negative charge? A sapphire is either charged or not. Should I 
<br>have been paying more attention while you were lecturing me on this stuff?"
<br>The Professor scowled at her quickly and walked over to one of the wagons. Clair followed. "You 
<br>are right, a sapphire is either charged or it isn't. Quite simple. Every farmer knows this. Put a 
<br>charged sapphire in a lantern and you have light for a few days or weeks, depending on the quality 
<br>and size of the gem. But", he stopped for a moment going through all sorts of apparatuses 
<br>underneath the tarp, "are you familiar with how glasses are made these days?"
<br>"Sure, I run one of the most prominent glass manufacturing businesses in all of Shima. I just hang 
<br>out at your place because of the great company and delicious food."
<br>The Professor surfaced a heavy box shaped.. thing? She wasn't sure what it actually was. It had lots 
<br>of mirrors, glass tubes, maybe some lenses or were they something else? Lots of gears and cables 
<br>connecting different parts of the box. It looked so foreign, she actually had never seen it anywhere 
<br>in the Professor's place. Normally he was quite proud of his experiments and gadgets and was 
<br>happy to show them to Clair, of course always with the thought of teaching her something. But this 
<br>abomination she had never seen before. "There we go", he said proudly. "Good that I actually 
<br>brought you with me my love." He had obvious problems with the weight of the contraption, even 
<br>though he had a quite muscular stature for a scholar.
<br>"So, what is this?" she asked. Her curiosity was sparked, something the Professor had hidden even 
<br>from her.
<br>"When our good friend Arth, the Highscholar, started to research charged sapphires, he found a way
<br>to change the nature of glass with the help of some good old fashioned luck and experiment. The 
<br>glass was after being processed by the machine easier to make into lenses for seeing aid. It made 
<br>him so much money he basically stopped researching entirely and spent his time with something 
<br>else, you know what. But I was fascinated by the notion to use the power of charged sapphires 
<br>without a Charged taking control of the power. And this is what I came up with." He pointed at the 
<br>contraption on the ground, but then went over tot he wagon to grab some other things. "So it uses 
<br>some interesting tricks to discharge the sapphires and focus their energy on a target. His version of 
<br>this only focused the energy on a surface maybe the size of your chest. I have been able to 
<br>concentrate on the surface of a thumbnail."
<br>"Why would you want that?"
<br>"Well, for example it can cut through solid iron. I call it The Lightning Cutter. The name is still a 
<br>work in progress though."
<br>Clair's eyes widened, "It can cut through iron? You are kidding, right?"
<br>"I wish I was, but it's true."
<br>"You make it sound like it's something bad. This could revolutionize everything. If we can use the 
<br>power of the storms in a way like this, we can make the lives of so many people easier. 
<br>Manufacturing of everything made from metals will change fundamentally."
<br>"Quite romantic thoughts you have there", he said while taking out another round metal ball with 
<br>lots of openings and iron rods. "But let's not talk about that now, we need to actually make this work
<br>before the storm front hits or we won't be able to have a conversation about this anymore. Grab 
<br>some of the stuff and get it over into the middle of the circle."
<br>"So, I know there are more pressing matters at hand, but just one question: why the actual fuck did 
<br>you bring a contraption like this with you? Not only does it take up enormous space and weight, but
<br>in a week or so you won't be able to use it at all. All sapphires will have lost their charge."
<br>The Professor sighed, "You might see good things resulting from it, and I wish for those things as 
<br>well. They are the reasons I was looking into it in the first place. But the reality is, that this thing 
<br>would see most use in warfare rather than in manufacturing. It's a weapon, which might be able to 
<br>puncture a Charged lightning cloak. What do you think it will do to normal soldiers on the front?" 
<br>Clair hadn't thought about that possibility at all. Why was she always so naive. It was so obvious 
<br>this thing would be used to kill people rather than make their lives easier. "And I couldn't leave it 
<br>back home", he said and heaved the thing up from the ground again. Clair was grabbing some of the
<br>other supplies. "Soruma has probably been going through my stuff like a little snooping rat since we
<br>left. He will use the things I have achieved and put his name on it to further his reputation and 
<br>diminish my own, but I don't care very much about that anymore. But I can't let him have this little 
<br>baby, and I couldn't bring myself to destroy it. So I brought it with us, lucky for us, really."
<br>"Let's just wait if it works or it burns us all alive."
<br>"I always thought I would die from one of my inventions."
<br>"Me too", Clair laughed and the Professor joined in. The thunder in the background was getting 
<br>quite loud now and the air was feeling electric. The other men from the caravan were still busy 
<br>carrying all material made from iron outside the circle of the wagons. The animals were getting 
<br>uneasy and Clair felt bad for them, they had no idea what was going on. They were probably even 
<br>more frightened than the people around them.
<br>Calandi came running when she saw them enter the barricaded circle, "What are you two carrying 
<br>there? I thought we should put all the metal outside the circle? What is going on? Will it work, Cy? 
<br>Can we actually survive this? Maybe we should have tried to get to the military outpost. A few 
<br>made their way there, but maybe we should have pressed harder on that. And now we are all stuck 
<br>here and.."
<br>"Breathe Calandi", the Professor said calmly. His voice was so steady and soothing. "Everything is 
<br>going to be alright. It might get a little rocky and the animals will get spooked, but I promise we 
<br>have made the correct decision in staying here." Well, at least he didn't promise her they would all 
<br>survive, Clair thought.
<br>"But what-"
<br>"Please Calandi", he interrupted, "let us work this out. I need you to keep everything else busy 
<br>doing something else and not get into our way. And try to calm the animals. I don't want to get 
<br>trampled by one of those bulls when the storm hits. Can you do that for me?" She nodded. "Alright. 
<br>Everything will be alright."
<br>Calandi scuffled off and Clair shouted after her, "Give the bulls some food and make someone 
<br>brush them. It tends to calm them." She nodded again and was off trying to give orders to the 
<br>frightened men.
<br>All of her muscles tensed up when she saw Deko walk over to them with a cigar in the corner of his 
<br>mouth. She always hated the smell and taste of smoke, especially cigars. It made her feel like 
<br>vomiting only seeing the swirls of smoke coming from the ignited end. "What are you two up to?" 
<br>he asked with his deep, dark voice.
<br>"Nothing that concerns you, Deko", Clair spat out. "But I see you are too busy to help around here, 
<br>so do us all a favor and be useless over there."
<br>"Feisty, isn't she today professor?" he laughed.
<br>The Professor didn't look up from his work, from where Clair was standing it looked like he was 
<br>getting the few sapphires they had collected from everybody into sockets of the round metal ball. "I 
<br>have no desire to engage in conversation with you. I would appreciate if you take Clair's suggestion 
<br>though."
<br>Deko ignored them both and looked intensely at the contraption. "Interesting little bit of junk you 
<br>got there. What does it do?" He exhaled another cloud of smoke, luckily the wind was blowing it 
<br>away from Clair.
<br>"Piece of junk?" the Professor asked flabbergasted and stopped what he was doing. "The only piece 
<br>of junk is your pathetic ass snooping around in our business. You either do something productive 
<br>with your time or shut the fuck up and let me concentrate. This contraption will either save or kill us
<br>all so please let me see to it, that it won't be the latter."
<br>Deko stepped a bit back, held out his hands in defense, but didn't say another word. The Professor 
<br>mounted his Lightning Cutter on a tripod pointing with one end to the ground, hopefully where the 
<br>energy would be directed to, and the other end straight up in the air. They then connected the round 
<br>ball to the contraption and built a little pole for it to be as high up as possible. "I would like it to be 
<br>a little higher, but this all we can get right now I suppose", the Professor said stepping back from 
<br>their little project. It looked quite pathetic. How can something like this save them from the 
<br>thunderstorm, Clair asked herself.
<br>"How far do you think it will keep us safe?" she asked him.
<br>"No idea. We will have to see when it all starts. The only problem now is turning it on. If we turn it 
<br>on too early, all the little energy we have in the sapphires will not keep the machine running for 
<br>long enough to let the storm fuel it. And if we do it too late, we are dead."
<br>"Great", she said dryly.
<br>"Stiffen up that upper lip, little lady", he said and smiled. "This will work out just fine, you'll see. 
<br>But now we wait."
<br>#
<br>An uneasy group of men and women were standing around the little iron pole the Professor and 
<br>Clair had built. Nobody was in the mood for talking much, and if so only in hushed voices or so 
<br>they sounded to Clair over the loud thunder. Some fell back to prayer and seeing if that will have 
<br>any impact, quite doubtful, Clair thought. She was running her finger through the short fur of one of
<br>the bulls. The air felt electric already and it was getting chilly, but with the warmth of the trusty bull
<br>she felt alright. The animals were getting quite uneasy and Clair had told them to round them up 
<br>into one big group so they could help each other. She had no idea if it was an actually good idea or 
<br>would make things even worse. She never had farm animals or worked on a farm. The concept was 
<br>even more foreign to her than the contraption the Professor had built in the middle of their 
<br>makeshift camp.
<br>The storm didn't care about any of this. It rolled forward over the land, unstoppable, unapologetic, 
<br>untouchable and without purpose. So carefree, she almost envied it.
<br>"Shh", she whispered in the bulls ears, "it's going to be alright. The professor built something really 
<br>nice, that is going to protect us from the lightning. It will only be quite loud, but that's all it's going 
<br>to be. Nothing but a little noise. Close your eyes and imagine you are somewhere else, anywhere 
<br>you want. Maybe a far reaching pasture with lots of delicious grass?" The bull didn't answer. "Well, 
<br>maybe something else then. A barn filled to the brim with hay, all your friends with you. In safety, 
<br>closed off from the storm." Maybe she was imagining it, but she felt like the bull nodded slightly. 
<br>"Where would I want to be?" she whispered to nobody at all.
<br>The thunder was strenuous on the ears by now, hundreds of lightnings striking the ground and 
<br>vanishing where they hit. It was still a mystery why the lightning strikes wouldn't have any effect on
<br>inanimate things. Rock, sand or even trees would stay mostly unharmed from the white bolts, but 
<br>people and animals were burned heavily or simply turned to ash after a few bolts hit their bodies. 
<br>The rain front hit them first, everything was dry a moment ago and then like a curtain of water 
<br>swiped over them carried by strong winds. The storm had reached them, turning the light of day 
<br>into the dark gray of dusk. Soon the onslaught of lightning bolts would make it as bright as day 
<br>again. She looked over to the Professor, who nodded at her staying ready for the perfect moment to 
<br>turn on the machine. He will find the right timing, she though.
<br>The bulls were getting antsy and Clair tried walking between them, brushing their warm bodies with
<br>her hands. Sometimes she bent down and shouted something in their ears, but they probably didn't 
<br>even know she was saying anything. The noise was so loud her ears actually start hurting. She tried 
<br>to look towards the east, but the wagons were in the way. The lightning front was close now, she 
<br>was sure of it.
<br>Looking around she found Deko standing as close to the metal pole as possible. Of course, he had 
<br>claimed one of the safest places around here. So they wouldn't get lucky and have him get struck by
<br>lightning. When he would get struck so close to the pole, they were all at risk of dying, so she didn't
<br>want to think about that. On the other hand, she thought, ridding the world of a slime like Deko was
<br>worth dying probably.
<br>Then a blue light shone from the little metal ball, they had put the charged sapphires in. Little 
<br>sparks flew around the poles and cables underneath and at the bottom a pale light started to emerge. 
<br>She couldn't see if it did anything to the ground, but it looked quite underwhelming. And this was 
<br>suppose to be used in warfare, she questioned. Maybe the Professor had exaggerated one of his 
<br>inventions again. It was something that happened quite frequently actually. But he looked satisfied 
<br>with his invention and was watching it with intense interest, as did Deko for some reason. He was 
<br>showing an odd interest in this machine, almost like he was studying it.
<br>The lightning front hit them merciless. The wind picked up even more and Clair's short hair stuck to
<br>her head like a wet second skin. The rain had completely drenched her. Lightning bolts suspended 
<br>the darkness that had began to shroud them. First it were only a couple hitting the ground around 
<br>them, some even hitting the wagons but dispersing into the ground without any reaction. As 
<br>predicted, most of them hit the little metal ball filled with sapphires powering the Cutter. More and 
<br>more lightning bolts rained down and instead of coming down in zig zag lines, they all bent towards
<br>the metal ball, like they were sucked into the machine. First only the ones in the immediate vicinity,
<br>but then more and more joined them. It looked like they were pulled into the contraption from the 
<br>skies themselves. The bolts were getting so close to each other, the light was blinding to the eyes 
<br>and everybody had to avert their eyes. It was spectacular. Even more so, the beam coming from the 
<br>machine, was getting just as white and blinding as the lightnings flooding in from the top. Like 
<br>some invisible shield over them, no bolt reached the ground around the pole.
<br>Clair started laughing and locked eyes with the Professor, who was ecstatic. He was probably 
<br>making notes in his head right now, ready to transcribe them as soon as the rain was going to stop. 
<br>He was harnessing the power of a thunderstorm without being a Charged. What else could the 
<br>lightning be used for? she asked herself.
<br>The machine was giving out high-pitched crackles every now and then. Out of the corner of her eye 
<br>she saw a big shape move suddenly. She turned towards it and saw the bulls getting anxious. The 
<br>sounds were making them more nervous than the lightning. One of them had broke lose from the 
<br>rest of the herd. Clair couldn't hear if he was making any sounds, but he looked like he wanted to 
<br>run. Not only would that mean certain death to the creature, but he could also take some of the 
<br>travelers with him. Clair dashed over to him, the rain hitting her in the face and making it hard to 
<br>see anything. The wind was creeping in through her wet clothes.
<br>The bull was shaking his head from side to side with no real direction to it. He seemed incredibly 
<br>anxious and even shivered when she put her hand on his back. Underneath the wet fur, he was warm
<br>and his muscles felt tense. She tried to rub the part of his forehead, like she did with all of them. He 
<br>didn't calm down though. She looked around and only saw the other people clear a path around the 
<br>bull, ready for it to run rampant away from them. The machine was giving them a greater area of 
<br>safety than she had anticipated, but this still wouldn't save the bull. There must be something she 
<br>could do for him.
<br>Looking for the Professor she understood quickly that he was absorbed in thought, watching his 
<br>little miracle unfold in front of him. She tried to shout, but he probably wouldn't have heard it even 
<br>he stood right next to her. So she put the head of the bull against her own head watching deep into 
<br>the big, dark eyes of him. She grabbed the head as tight as she could, giving the animal no room to 
<br>sway from left to right like he had done before. It worked for a moment, but then a tarp from one of 
<br>the wagons was blown lose by the strong wind and hit the two from the side. The sudden impact 
<br>and darkness made the animal lose all control and reason, so it broke out. It happened so quickly, 
<br>Clair tried to get away, but she couldn't let go. Not because the tarp was holding her onto the 
<br>animal, but because she couldn't let him go. He was frightened, they all were. Nobody cared about 
<br>him. It wasn't right. She held on tightly trying to calm it down. With one hand she was holding 
<br>herself on the horns of the bull, her body clenching the back of the bull. With the other one she 
<br>pried the tarp away, maybe if he saw the light again he would come back to his senses and calm 
<br>down.
<br>When the tarp fell off, he wasn't stopping. They were heading towards the line of wagons, she 
<br>couldn't do anything now. They would hit the barricade, whatever happened after that was 
<br>impossible to foresee. Then the bull shook his head and body so hard, Clair was catapulted off the 
<br>animal and landed in the mud, slithering for few meters on the wet ground before finally coming to 
<br>a halt. It was like he had wanted to help her and not run her to her death. The bull was still running 
<br>straight towards the wagons and Clair tried to reach him with her left arm, but it was of course a 
<br>stupid gesture. She couldn't do anything anymore, couldn't reach him. She was shouting for him to 
<br>stop without, but the thunder was so loud she couldn't even hear her own words. They were simply 
<br>sucked from her mouth when they left her cold lips. All she could do, was watch the tragedy unfold.
<br>Powerless as always. Tears were forming in her eyes.
<br>She felt a firm, but gentle hand land on her shoulder. In the same instance a blinding light hit her 
<br>stretched out arm and everything went numb, from her hand down her whole body. Even her heart 
<br>seemed to stop beating for the moment. She didn't feel any pain, but she could smell her skin and 
<br>flesh burn.<br></p>
