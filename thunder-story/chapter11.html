            <p>Chapter 10
<br>
<br>
<br>Clair was nervous. It wasn't like her anymore to get nervous when a day of work began. She knew 
<br>what was expected of her, most of her customers were regulars and she had no reason to be nervous 
<br>about it. Other emotions were far more common like disgust or anger, but being nervous was not 
<br>one of them usually. But today was a rather special day for her and everything needed to go as 
<br>planned to be successful. A lot depended on it.
<br>She brushed her long hair and then braided it into a long braid she would lay over her left shoulder. 
<br>The Lord was quite specific on how she had to look for him every time. Clair wasn't absolutely 
<br>sure, but it wasn't hard to guess who she was impersonating. As long as she was the only object of 
<br>his pleasure, she was happy with that. Better her than his own daughter. At least it was her hope that
<br>made this weekly endeavor a little bit easier to stomach.
<br>Inside the flock of hair she braided three strands of wool, two red and one blue. Clair opened the 
<br>upper drawer of her desk and got out the incredible sapphire necklace the Lord had gifted her, well 
<br>gifted in a sense that she was supposed to wear it when he was around, but never at any other point 
<br>in time. He was indeed a generous man. The freshly charged gems were pulsating and felt cold on 
<br>her bare skin. She watched herself in the mirror and had to admit, they looked beautiful. It gave her 
<br>face a certain glow and made her look wealthy and not like a street kid at all. She then quickly 
<br>changed into the uniform he had bought for her. It was the traditional girls school uniform of the 
<br>royal schools around Shima. A dark blue skirt, which went over the knees and a white blouse with 
<br>one long sleeve and one short sleeve. On the right side of her chest was the school emblem, a red 
<br>rabbit with long ears looking up.
<br>One last look into the mirror she checked if everything was in order. Necklace, braid, uniform, no 
<br>make-up and an innocent smile. Everything as ordered. She checked if she smelled bad and decided 
<br>to put on another whiff of perfume just to be safe. Being nervous always made her sweat quite a bit 
<br>and she couldn't afford to put the Lord of in the slightest. He was a vital part to her plan and if he 
<br>wasn't happy she wouldn't be able to persuade him.
<br>Closing the door behind her, she walked along the hallway towards the staircase, when she heard 
<br>soft sobbing from on the doors to her right. She counted the doors from hers and was surprised, 
<br>because normally this room was empty. This could only mean one thing. Clair knocked softly on the
<br>door and the sobbing stopped immediately. "Can I come in for a moment?" she asked softly, but 
<br>there was no answer. So she simply opened the door and went inside, there was no reason to wait. 
<br>She wouldn't get an answer most likely.
<br>Entering the room, it looked just like any of the others. A small little space with a table and mirror 
<br>to get ready, a small wardrobe for costumes and other work outfits, a space for washing and hygiene
<br>and a bed to sleep in. Not much had room in here anyway, but most girls had decorated their rooms 
<br>at least a little bit. Clair for example, had quite the collection of books to show for by now. She first 
<br>thought some of the customers were actually just generous, getting her books as presents, but she 
<br>quickly understood it wasn't like that at all.
<br>On the bed lay a small ball of blankets, but a little head poked out the end to see who had entered 
<br>the room.
<br>"Hi", Clair said and slowly approached the bed. "I am Clair, we are kind of neighbors. I live just a 
<br>couple of doors down the hall. What's your name?"
<br>The little girl pushed away a bit more of her blankets and exposed her face completely. She had 
<br>obviously been crying for some time now, her eyes were all red and her cheeks wet. She had short, 
<br>matted hair, a beautiful face and looked about eleven. It still wasn't normal for Clair to see girls this 
<br>young within these walls. She herself was barely fifteen and had been working for Sakara about two
<br>years now. But eleven? She was just a child.
<br>"Don't worry, I am not going to hurt you. I am your friend actually, well as close to that as possible. 
<br>Don't you want to tell me your name?" Her eyes were wide and she was hiding in the furthest corner
<br>of her bed.
<br>"Carai", she whispered and wiped away some of the tears. Clair slowly walked to the bed and sat 
<br>down on the opposite side of the bed as Carai. She wanted to be as far away as possible, but still as 
<br>near as possible to give her at least a little feeling of safety.
<br>"Did you arrive today?" Clair asked. The little girl nodded. "How old are you, Carai?"
<br>"Ten", she answered and snuffled. Ten years, by the Gods, Clair thought. In Shima you were 
<br>normally allowed to marry with fifteen and even that was changing. People weren't so desperate 
<br>anymore to marry off their children as quickly as possible, but were waiting longer and longer for 
<br>them to have an opinion in the decision as well.
<br>"Are you hungry?" The little girl shook her head. Clair wasn't sure what to say to her. What does 
<br>one say to a ten year old child beginning her life in Sakara's house? There simply was no way of 
<br>preparing her and no way of taking away any of the fear she was obviously experiencing. And Clair 
<br>was running out of time. The Lord was strict about punctuality. "What did Sakara say you have do 
<br>today?"
<br>"Is she the old lady? The one with the fake smile?" Clair had trouble holding back a loud laugh, but 
<br>had to chuckle at least. She had almost forgot how direct children could be.
<br>"Yes, that's Sakara. She must have gave you some things you need to do for the day."
<br>"She told me a few things, but I don't know how to do any of them. She told me to go downstairs 
<br>and take a long bath to wash up all the dirt and filth. But it is scary down there, with all the drunk 
<br>people. I don't like it. And they probably have to cut off my hair, she said. I don't want them to cut 
<br>off my hair. I know it's a little messy, but I like it this way. What will I look without any hair?"
<br>Clair was close to crying, "I have an idea. Why don't we go down together. You don't need to worry,
<br>there is a different way to get to the basement, without having to go past the lobby. We girls use it 
<br>all the time, but I guess they failed to tell you about that. But that's what I am here for, alright?"
<br>Carai slowly nodded, but wasn't convinced obviously.
<br>"And about your hair. I think you will look good even without your hair. It will grow back in no 
<br>time."
<br>"But what about in the mean time? I will look like an old man." It was probably a good thing for her
<br>to get rid of the hair entirely. Maybe she would have very few customers because of it. But then 
<br>again, who would want to spend the night with a ten year old child in the first place? Maybe a bald 
<br>head wasn't enough to deter these kind of people.
<br>"You will see it's going to be alright. You can wear a hat for the time until your hair has grown back.
<br>They have lots of beautiful hats. What is your favorite color?"
<br>The girl though about it for a moment, "Black", she said.
<br>"They definitely have a black one, I am sure of it because I wore lots of black hats already." Time to
<br>get going, Clair though. "Come one", she stood up from the bed and extended her hand towards the 
<br>frightened girl. "It will  be quick and you will feel a lot better after a warm bath."
<br>Slowly the child crawled out from under her blankets and took Clair's hand. Hers was tiny and cold.
<br>Her clothes were tattered and Clair saw bruises on her body. "We have to hurry a little though. I am 
<br>running late."
<br>"I am sorry", the girl said. "You don't have to show me. I think I can do it myself now."
<br>"Don't worry. We always make time for each other. It's something you can count on." Clair smiled 
<br>and for a moment she thought Carai would smile back, but her mouth just twitched a little.
<br>Clair lead the girl around the house down the second stairway to the basement, where she dropped 
<br>her off to one of the maids. But the child wouldn't let go of her hand and looked even more 
<br>frightened now than before. Clair went down to one knee and took both of her hands in her own. 
<br>"You have to be very strong now, alright? Just do what the people here tell you to do. They won't 
<br>expect anything bad from you, just that you wash yourself right and scrub everything off. And when
<br>you are ready you can go back to your room. And tonight, when I come back, I will come to your 
<br>room, alright? I will bring another girl with me, Oria she is called, and we will talk about everything
<br>you have to know and you can ask us everything you want, alright? It's going to be okay, you just 
<br>have to be brave right now. Can you do that?"
<br>Carai nodded slowly and Clair released her hands. She pushed her gently to go into the washroom. 
<br>The little girl looked back once and Clair smiled at her. She hoped the girl could handle what was 
<br>coming towards her.
<br>She then dashed towards the stairway again trying to make up at least a little of her lost time. 
<br>Hopefully the Lord was in a good mood today, or her plan was already doomed.
<br>#
<br>Outside of Sakara's establishment a small carriage was waiting for Clair. In front, six men were 
<br>waiting and ready to pull them around the city. The sky was clouded and a slight breeze was going 
<br>through Shima at this day. Good for the men, she thought. Going up and down the hills would make
<br>them sweat quickly and the late spring sun would only make it harder on them. Especially since 
<br>Clair was planning to go through the whole city into the northern district. She only needed to 
<br>convince the Lord is was in his interest as well. Hopefully he was in a good mood today or the 
<br>carriage ride would fall quite short and they would simply go around a few houses and end up here 
<br>again. She breathed in deeply and went on.
<br>She stepped towards the door and opened it to get inside. It was something the Lord hated 
<br>profusely, not being able to help her inside the carriage, but he was reliant on secrecy. It wouldn't be
<br>good for him, if his family knew what he was doing when he was for business in Shima. So they 
<br>had to stay inside the whole time going about the city. The slight possibility of getting caught was 
<br>exhilarating for the Lord though.
<br>"I thought we have talked about punctuality already, my dear", he remarked when Clair stepped into
<br>the carriage. His voice was cool, but welcoming. He wasn't in a bad mood today. There was still 
<br>hope. The doors of the carriage had little windows, hung with curtains so nobody would be able to 
<br>identify them, but they had at least the possibility of looking outside during the ride.
<br>"I apologize deeply, my Lord", Clair said looking down towards her hands. He loved it, when she 
<br>was showing remorse. Or faking remorse. "I was helping another student with some of the 
<br>homework she didn't understand and forgot the time a little bit."
<br>"I guess that is alright", he said. Clair closed the door and sat down next to him. The carriage was so
<br>small, that there was barely any space between her and the Lord. He wasn't a big man, but rather 
<br>slender with long brown hair and green eyes. He wasn't even looking half bad for the clients she 
<br>was used to normally, but he was old enough to her father. "Where do you want to go today?" he 
<br>asked and opened a little window at the front to speak to the pulling men.
<br>Be vague, but not too vague. "I was thinking we could maybe go north today? Last time we were 
<br>down at the harbor and that was fun, but I never seen the northern part of Shima myself."
<br>"The northern district?" he pondered. "I suppose the northern part isn't that interesting at all and 
<br>rather far away from where we are. It will probably take us around an hour to get there if we are 
<br>lucky, probably more. How did you get the idea?"
<br>"Well, today in school we were learning about the city and its various districts. From the harbor and 
<br>warehouse districts to the industrial ones and noble districts. We also learned, that the northern 
<br>district is reserved for the church with temples, monasteries and even schools of the church. And it 
<br>isn't so populated, so we would have lots of privacy up there." He had planned this for weeks now, 
<br>trying to pack the real reason into their role play. She wasn't expecting for him to just agree out 
<br>right, but for that case she had phase two.
<br>"I don't know, my dear. It's quite a long ride and I would rather spend some time alone with you and
<br>not traveling through the dirty streets of Shima. I was thinking of making a little detour to the sea 
<br>for a bit and then leave through the southern gate to take a stroll through the woods." He loved the 
<br>woods, nobody around to see or hear what was going on.
<br>But Clair wasn't going to budge so easily. She still had a trump card in her deck. "My Lord, please I 
<br>am begging you", she pleaded and places her hands on his thigh. He loved it when she begged for 
<br>something. "I was looking forward to it the whole week, since I last saw you. And I told all my 
<br>friends we would go there and I don't want to have tell them we weren't there after all. Please, 
<br>please, I am begging you."
<br>The Lord looked at her, but Clair could see he wasn't persuaded at all. "I really want to fulfill your 
<br>wish, I do, but I think it's more important for us to spend some quality time together. I haven't seen 
<br>you all week, because my schedule has been so difficult altely and I don't want you to think I am 
<br>neglecting you. How can we do that going around the capital in this carriage? You know we have to 
<br>preserve some amount of secrecy, sadly enough."
<br>Yes, so sad, she thought. Time to go for it. "My Lord, I wasn't suggesting anything less than what 
<br>you want. I, too, was looking forward to some alone time with you, so I was thinking we can do it 
<br>like this: we drive up to the northern district and have lots of time to talk and take in the bustling 
<br>city around us. I think you have lots to teach me still about the city I don't know, it's always so 
<br>interesting." He also loved flattery even if it sounded as fake as Clair did right now. "And then on 
<br>the way back I thought we could close up the windows completely and have some privacy that way.
<br>I will promise, I will be as quiet as a mouse. And if you can't trust me with that, I have brought 
<br>something with me to ensure it." Clair turned to the side and grabbed the gag inside her little bag 
<br>she had brought just for this instance. It was Oria's idea really. She had told Clair, that a lot of men 
<br>like the Lord would go crazy if she suggested something they normally used herself, like it was her 
<br>idea or that she actually enjoyed it. And Oria was not mistaken. As soon as the Lord had gotten his 
<br>eyes on the little black gag, his favorite at that, he tensed up and his look changed completely. She 
<br>dangled the gag in front of her face with one hand and with the other she played with her long braid.
<br>The way the Lord looked at her was so familiar to Clair by now it frightened her. She saw the 
<br>desire, the lust in his eyes. She could even smell it, if that was even possible. The whole air in the 
<br>carriage seemed to have changed into something thicker, it wasn't the fresh air she wanted to 
<br>breathe, but something that made her want to vomit with every breath she took. It was invading her 
<br>body and she couldn't do anything about it, she couldn't stop breathing until it was over. No, she had
<br>to sit and endure it every time.
<br>The Lord turned towards the little window again and shouted orders towards the men. They were 
<br>going to the northern district. He couldn't resist the new fantasy she had provided him. He was keen
<br>on not being found out by his family, but he also liked the close line they were walking and he 
<br>wasn't afraid to push it. He quickly took the gag from Clair and stashed it in his own pocket, it 
<br>wasn't time yet. The carriage started to move forward and Clair was watching the houses slowly 
<br>move by. The Lord started to strike up a conversation, but Clair was only listening with half an ear. 
<br>Her thoughts were circling only around one thing now, San.
<br>The conversation was most of the time very alike. The Lord would either ask Clair about school or 
<br>how she was getting along with her friends. Clair had become quite adept at creating little stories, 
<br>weaving the girls at the house into her stories without giving it away to him. Helping Carai through 
<br>the first hours of her first time became helping her with homework and so it happened with a lot of 
<br>things. Only real things, like her family and her brother were things she never shared with anyone, 
<br>not even packed into a story. They didn't deserve any of her personal life. Besides that the Lord 
<br>would often show her buildings around the city, some he owned himself, some he helped build or 
<br>simply new the architect and was always sure to dump all the details he knew onto Clair. Sometimes
<br>it was rather interesting to hear how a theater or some of the big gateways were built, but today she 
<br>had no interest.
<br>Clair was getting nervous again. Now that she had persuaded him to go to the northern district, 
<br>things were actually getting serious. Would she be able to see her brother today? She didn't know 
<br>exactly where he was or in which school Sakara had shipped him off, but something wasn't quite 
<br>right to her. The letters she had received were getting inconsistent and she was simply afraid that 
<br>things were going as they seemed. By now, San should be able to write the letters himself, but she 
<br>still received the one page every two weeks written by one of the priests and not him. Something 
<br>wasn't right.
<br>I am coming, San, she thought.<br></p>
