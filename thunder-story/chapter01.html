            <p>Prologue
<br>
<br>
<br>Looking down onto the battlefield, Dericho was shaking. This was his first battle, his first war he 
<br>was ever a part of. He had just come of age and finished his basic training program. He had been 
<br>one of the best at the military academy and so the King had picked him personally to join the Giran,
<br>the special unit adept in dealing with enemy Charged. By now the enemy hadn't fielded his Charged
<br>and so Dericho and his squad were still on stand by. They were standing on a small hilltop with the 
<br>commanders giving out orders with errand boys overlooking the whole battlefield. In the stories 
<br>battles and wars had been made out to be something heroic, something where legends were forged, 
<br>but this wasn't what he had expected. It was a lot slower than he had expected. The lines of soldiers 
<br>crashing together and barely moving back of forward. Men poking with their spears and hiding 
<br>behind their shields. But already the cried of the wounded were sounding louder than the clanking 
<br>of iron on iron and wood. Medics were running through the lines trying to salvage whatever they 
<br>could. Most would probably die being trampled or executed by the enemy.
<br>"Where are the brothers?", Dericho's captain asked. "Why don't they join the battle yet? Their army 
<br>is losing." Dericho couldn't see it. It looked like nobody was losing nor winning. The lines of men 
<br>barely moved in the last half an hour.
<br>"I won't complain", Paro said, Dericho's best friend he knew since they had started at the academy. 
<br>They had lasted through the whole program together and had made it into the Giran. "I am not so 
<br>keen on fighting the White Flames of the North, if I am being totally honest Captain."
<br>"They will come", the Captain said. "They have to, or lose what they have gained up to this point. 
<br>And they don't strike me as the men, who will surrender after conquering two kingdoms already. 
<br>But they won't do the same to ours, I will see to it personally."
<br>Dericho checked his equipment again. It always calmed him down, going through the mundane 
<br>check list. It was something he knew and was accustomed to. Something to occupy his head. On his
<br>back he had fastened a heavy wood club with iron plating around, used to crush through the 
<br>lightning cloak of a Charged. He had no use for swords or knives, they wouldn't fight any normal 
<br>soldiers, they had an extra squad protecting them against those. The Giran's only objective was to 
<br>kill or injure a Charged to the point of making them redraw from the battlefield. On his side hung 
<br>multiple, thing iron cords with a small iron ball at the end as a weight so it could be thrown and 
<br>would wrap around the targets arms and legs.
<br>It felt like their whole army held their breath when they saw two pure white silhouettes crash into 
<br>their ranks. They had flown in through a high arch, higher than any of their Charged could ever 
<br>manage. Their entry was already devastating. Under the cheering of their own army the two 
<br>brothers cut through the ranks like it was nothing. Highly training soldiers in full formation were 
<br>being decimated, long swipes of their giant gold swords splitting men in half with their armor on. 
<br>This was the power of a charged, beyond anything a normal mortal was able to imagine. But they 
<br>had a weakness and the Giran were ready to exploit it.
<br>"Let's move out", the Captain cried out. In total they had four squads of Giran ready for 
<br>deployment, two for every brother. They didn't have more Charged anyway. To think they had 
<br>conquered two whole kingdoms with their inferior numbers and only two Charged was still 
<br>puzzling to most. It had come out of nothing.
<br>Lord Morogan had joined Dericho's squad and would lead them as their Charged to draw attention 
<br>of one the brothers. While the Lord was trying to keep him busy, Dericho and his squad would try 
<br>and go in for the kill.
<br>"Are you ready?" Paro asked him.
<br>"I am shitting my pants", he answered and got a laugh.
<br>"We all are, brother", Paro said and slapped him on the back.
<br>"Unit A and B are moving to the right flank", the Captain's voice bellowed. "The rest are with me 
<br>and Lord Morogan, we take the left. Let's show them whose land this is." The men cheered and they
<br>rushed towards the two enemy brothers.
<br>When their unit hit the back rows of the army, the soldiers quickly parted to make a small alley for 
<br>them to advance quickly further into the battlefield. The men looked worried and anxious, seeing 
<br>how many of their own men were being slaughtered in front of them. They were trying to hold of 
<br>the onslaught, but the Charged ripped through squad after squad, splintering shields, breaking 
<br>spears and crushing bones. The one brother they had to fight had left a giant hole in their ranks, 
<br>making it easy for the enemy army to advance and attack from multiple sides. If they didn't do 
<br>something quickly, the battle could actually be lost.
<br>The Lord activated his lightning cloak, creating a protective layer of pure lightning around his 
<br>whole body. His eyes turned to a haunting white and his long black hair started to rise into the air 
<br>like he was submerged in water. The familiar crackling of a Charged was mixed into the cries of the 
<br>dying. Next to the enemy brother, Lord Morogan looked rather pathetic. His cloak was barely half 
<br>the intensity and didn't extend as far beyond his body, but it was all they had right now. But that's 
<br>why they had brought two units of Giran with them, hadn't they?
<br>Morogan jumped towards the enemy and landed with a audible thump on the ground dozens of 
<br>meters ahead of Dericho and his squad. They started running and getting their weapons ready. He 
<br>unbuckled one of the iron chords, hooked it into his sapphire satchel and rushed towards the duel 
<br>site. He still didn't understand enough about the science of how the sapphires worked and held 
<br>lightning energy, but it worked and that was all that counted for Dericho.
<br>The two Charged exchanged blows so fast and intense it was hard to follow them at all. Sometimes 
<br>they were so fast, everything got blurry, only lines of white flashes and thundering blows. The two 
<br>units of Giran swarmed out to surround the two Charged. Paro gave Dericho a last look of good 
<br>luck and nodded towards him before running off to his right. The captain shouted orders all around, 
<br>but they were mostly for the normal soldiers trying to built a secure perimeter around them, so they 
<br>could get to work. Dericho and his unit knew what was to be done.
<br>He swung his iron chord, slowly picking up speed. The familiar buzzing of the chord was music to 
<br>his ears. He must be careful now though, hitting their own Charged could mean the end, he was 
<br>already highly outmatched. The Lord was in cloud stance, a stance only used for blocking and 
<br>evading attacks of a Charged. He was the distraction and without him the two units of Giran could 
<br>be easily slaughtered just like all the other men around Dericho on the ground. He tried not to look 
<br>down, but the smell gave it away anyway. It was a mixture of blood and shit, something he never 
<br>thought he would smell on the battlefield of all places. This wasn't the place where heroes were 
<br>made.
<br>Dericho tried to get closer to the dueling Charged, but it was fruitless. The long sweeps of their 
<br>giant, lightning empowered swords were too dangerous. Then the Lord dodged a lunge attack from 
<br>the enemy and it left a short opening for the Giran. Almost in unison all of their men, who stood at 
<br>the left side of the circle released their chords, humming through the air and trying to hit their 
<br>target. It was a hard move to pull off, the small bead at the end of the chord was suppose to wrap 
<br>around the enemy's arm or legs and would then suck some of the lightning power into the empty 
<br>sapphires waiting in their satchels at the side.
<br>Dericho's chord cut through the air and missed completely. "Shit", he muttered. The Charged didn't 
<br>get dodged, he wanted it to happen. He ducked underneath the incoming chords and was catapulted 
<br>towards the Giran around him. He crushed into two of them cutting them down immediately, their 
<br>bodies cut into two halves. Blood and intestines sprayed through the air and the smell of burned 
<br>flesh drifted over to him. Dericho retracted his chord quickly to get ready for another round and the 
<br>Lord crashed into the brother to give them another try.
<br>"Formation 42", the Captain shouted over the thundering and battle noise. So it was all or nothing 
<br>then. Formation 42 meant the enemy had to be stopped under all circumstances, even if it meant 
<br>sacrificing men of their own.
<br>The Lord understood himself as well, somehow hearing what the Captain had shouted and threw 
<br>himself at the brother trying to engulf him with his own body. The brother was taken so by surprise,
<br>the Lord was able to wrap his arms around him for just a second. But it was enough because 
<br>Dericho and the rest of the two units already released their chords, wrapping around both of the 
<br>charged and taking away their lightning cloak. The blinding white light emitted by the two dimmed 
<br>considerably, until they heard the cries of pain. The Lord's cloak had vanished completely while the 
<br>enemy's was still somewhat intact. It was burning him alive, they had to move quickly.
<br>Dericho unlatched his big iron plated club from his back and charged towards the two. He was there
<br>barely in time, the Lord already unconscious or dead, he wasn't sure and it wasn't important right 
<br>now. Dericho was the first on sight and swung his club over his head for the maximum force behind
<br>it. Breaking through a lightning cloak was impossible, but it didn't protect against the impact force 
<br>completely. So a club could bruise the skin and bones underneath the cloak. Repeating it multiple 
<br>times could actually impair the user so much he could lose the ability to draw lightning from his 
<br>sapphires.
<br>The club hit with a satisfying thump, the lightning licking around the club sending shivers down 
<br>Dericho's spine. He hit again and again, always trying to hit the same point, his knee cap. The joints
<br>were the most vulnerable, which could actually break with enough impact. Paro joined to his right 
<br>and two other guys to Dericho's left, all hacking away on the Charged on the ground. It wasn't 
<br>heroic, it wasn't beautiful. It was barbaric and felt wrong. They were beating on a human laying on 
<br>the ground unable to move. The lightning cloak flickering more and more, receding with every hit 
<br>he took. They were close and Dericho was happy it was over soon. He grinned over to his friend, 
<br>who was grinning back. Bringing down one of the White Flames of the North must be getting them 
<br>all the girls when they would return.
<br>But they shouldn't have celebrated so early.
<br>The ground shook when the second brother landed right next to them, blazing white. His crackling 
<br>cloak drowned all of the other noises, but he didn't leave Dericho any time to think. With a quick 
<br>sweep of his long blade he cut the heads off the men on Dericho's left. The tip grazed his face, 
<br>cutting deep into his flesh. He lost control over his club and let it fall to the ground holding both of 
<br>his hands against the wound on his face. He smelled his own burned flesh and felt the searing pain. 
<br>The cut must have been as long as half his face, even his ear seemed to be cut off completely, he 
<br>didn't hear anything on his left side anymore. He took a step back away from the Charged, but 
<br>toppled over something on the ground falling down on his back.
<br>He saw Paro try to run away as well, but the Charged was faster, wielding his sword in an elegant 
<br>turn around and cutting Dericho's best friend in half. The blade didn't even slow down when 
<br>meeting his flesh. It cut through like it was nothing. The two halves of his best friend fell onto him, 
<br>burying him underneath them. He tried to cry out or shout for help, but he couldn't move. He was 
<br>completely paralyzed feeling his friends warm body on top of him. The blood was seeping out of 
<br>the long wound onto his face. It was so much he had to close his eyes letting the gore cover his face 
<br>completely, some getting into his mouth making him gag, some clogging up his nose making it 
<br>impossible to breathe. His stomach revolted and released its insides, before Dericho's vision closed 
<br>in on him and left him with only darkness.<br></p>
