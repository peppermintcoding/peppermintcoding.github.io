            <p>Chapter4
<br>
<br>
<br>Clair rushed through the hallways checking every room. Bathroom. Bedroom. Bedroom. Bedroom. 
<br>Bathroom. All furnished fit for a king, or so she thought of them. She never was inside the 
<br>Emperors quarters, but she couldn't imagine anything more luxurious and redundant than this. So 
<br>many carpets, paintings, vases and plants. But no sight of Zaran and Karan. She needed to find them
<br>quickly. This was their chance to escape with whatever the two had gathered. Luck was back on 
<br>their side as Sali had to investigate something that happened on the other side of the manor, in one 
<br>of the gardens. She couldn't hear what was going on exactly, because the guard whispered it in Sali's
<br>ear, but it was enough to get the gist that they were not looking for the brothers and so they had a 
<br>small window to escape. He left her with the words, "I hope we meet again, Clair, and can finish 
<br>our discussion. I look forward to it", and then vanished with the guard through another door on the 
<br>other side of the dining room.
<br>Where were they? She darted around a corner and finally stumbled upon the cleaning wagon and 
<br>two open doors. She barged through one of the open doors and found Karan going through some of 
<br>the drawers. "Karan, put it all back and help me get the wagon out of here. We have to leave, now!" 
<br>Her voice startled him so much he almost fell over.
<br>"You could have knocked or something and not scare the Gods out of me", he said angrily, but did 
<br>as he was told and closed all the drawers. "While you were busy entertaining the rich boy, we were 
<br>hard at work. I hope we can even lift the wagon down the stairs again. We got some good stuff, 
<br>Clair. Real good stuff."
<br>"Let's talk about it when we left the noble's district. Sali is distracted right now, but I don't know 
<br>when he will come back. Get your brother and let's go."
<br>"You already know his name, how romantic", he teased and went to get his brother. Zaran was deep 
<br>inside one of the wardrobes. This one was like another room inside the giant bedroom, probably 
<br>belonging to one of the four daughters. The room was bigger than the house Clair grew up in. So 
<br>many shoes, dresses and coats. Even pelts and jewelry was plenty inside. They all helped together 
<br>to get everything back to normal and Clair was bombarded with remarks about her dining 
<br>experience with the little rich boy, as they called him.
<br>The stairs were their last obstacle and then they only had to walk out the door and never look back. 
<br>It was too heavy to just carry it, like they did to get it upstairs. They had to heave it one step at a 
<br>time, letting the heavy wagon thump on every step along the way. Halfway down Clair saw a guard 
<br>walk by through the lobby.
<br>He frowned and stopped in his tracks, "Do you guys need some help?"
<br>"Oh no, you are too kind, but we got it", Clair replied quickly, trying to make her voice sound as 
<br>normal as possible. Her hands were shaking. "The two are just tired from the long day. We are up 
<br>since before sunrise, I think you can relate. But we will get through it just like we always do, we 
<br>don't want to trouble you with any of our business."
<br>He watched them for a second, then shrugged and went his way leaving the three thieves to breathe 
<br>again.
<br>"That was close", Zaran said while breathing heavily.
<br>"Come on", Karan said with a red face, "this wagon is getting really, really heavy. No time for a 
<br>break before we aren't out."
<br>"He is right", Clair said and tried to help the boys, awkwardly grabbing one of the sides of the 
<br>wooden vehicle.
<br>Approaching the door, they opened it themselves before the guards outside helped them. Outside 
<br>night had almost fallen on Shima and the two moons were starting to employ their dominance on 
<br>the sky again. The three got out their coats from the wagon, being careful not to show any of their 
<br>loot. The air was cold, but all too refreshing for Clair. She felt like she could finally breathe 
<br>normally again. Only a few more meters of walking and they would be in safety.
<br>When they were out of range of any guards Clair asked, "Where did you put all the cleaning stuff to
<br>make room by the way?"
<br>The brothers laughed, "We emptied all the bottles everywhere and stashed the remaining stuff in 
<br>every little nook and cranny we could find. They will find memories of this robbery for weeks."
<br>#
<br>The way back to the thieves' lair was trivial. They avoided the main streets and intersections. It was 
<br>more tedious, but what were a few more hours of walking with a treasure right beside them, a 
<br>treasure they had because of Clair.
<br>"What will you do with your share, Clair?" Zaran asked.
<br>"Hm", she thought about it for a moment, "probably get me and my brother a room alone and the 
<br>rest will be spend on new clothes, good food and some books. I want to be able to teach my brother 
<br>to read and write."
<br>"I will buy myself the biggest piece of chocolate I can find", Zaran said, Clair laughed. "If you want
<br>a taste, you can try a nibble." He winked at her.
<br>"I guessed that means things will change though", Karan said. He was right. Hopefully for the 
<br>better. At the moment they were at the bottom of the hierarchy, but with this robbery Morlan would 
<br>be forced to reward them. No, he would want to reward them, because they were finally bringing in 
<br>the big money. Maybe he would even promote Clair to have a bigger crew. A fresh wind was always
<br>good, it was necessary.
<br>Going around another corner they finally reached the lair, their safe house and origin of the whole 
<br>operation Morlan was running. It was in the outer ring of Shima, far beyond the inner walls, and far 
<br>enough away from the harbor and merchant districts to have it nice and quiet. Perfectly incognito.
<br>Ruki was on look out greeting them and opening the door. "I see you were successful", she smiled. 
<br>"Even better, Morlan is in a great mood today. He had some visitor and something is going down 
<br>tonight. I guessed it's your lucky day."
<br>The lair was very quiet at this time of the day, normal crews were working at night and so the whole
<br>building was eerily empty. "Leave the wagon here and let's go up to Morlan", Karan said who was 
<br>sweating through the cleaning uniform underneath his coat. The wooden steps were creaking 
<br>underneath their boots, nobody said another word. It was somehow different than Clair had 
<br>imagined it. She thought they would be more celebrating and optimism, but somehow everybody 
<br>was in their own thoughts. They were probably thinking about what to do with their share of the 
<br>robbery. Morlan was taking the biggest cut, but with the amount they had looted it was enough to 
<br>get by for quite some time. It meant safety and privileges, something nobody of them had often. Too
<br>many failed jobs.
<br>Morlan's office was at the very top of the building right underneath the roof. The air was warm and 
<br>candles were burning on the walls for lighting. The flames danced on their little black wicks. 
<br>Contrary to many others, Clair always thought flames to be more alive than charged sapphires. To 
<br>many the lightning within the sapphire was almost like living in thing, but flames were so much 
<br>more fascinating and unique than the lightning. They not only had no money to keep sapphires for 
<br>lighting, they also would vanish quickly, being sold somewhere to get some money for food or a 
<br>drink or two. At the end, this was a lair of thieves and not a noble's house.
<br>Opening the door, there was a sharp smell of smoke. The boss doesn't smoke, Clair thought. Morlan
<br>was sitting behind his desk with piles of papers, gold pieces and always an open bottle of liquor. He 
<br>was a large man, in height as well as in width. Weighing probably four times as much as Clair he 
<br>was feared for a reason. His temper wasn't making it any easier to be comfortable around him. His 
<br>harsh face and red nose made him appear so ugly it was only because of his strength he wasn't a 
<br>target for ridicule.
<br>But today he was smiling like a child. On the other side of the table sat a stranger Clair had never 
<br>seen before. He was the one smoking a thick, round cigar. He wasn't turning around but blew 
<br>another thick cloud of smoke into the air. It swirled up towards the ceiling and disappeared slowly. 
<br>Where does it go? Clair thought.
<br>"You are late", he grunted at them.
<br>"Yes, but we have a good reason", Clair replied, trying to decipher the meaning of his smile. He 
<br>didn't seem more drunk than usual. Maybe it really was because of this mysterious visitor. "We did 
<br>it. We have enough to pay our debts and then some. You will be very happy with our loot. It's 
<br>waiting right down stairs." Clair was proud of herself. This would get her finally some more 
<br>responsibility and credit with the boss.
<br>"And where did you get it from, if I might ask?"
<br>This was the point she was waiting for. Now he would be utterly impressive with her. "We robbed 
<br>the manor of the Azumaja family. Got all the stuff from right under their stupid noses."
<br>Morlan walked around the table towards the little group. Karan and Zaran stepped back a bit 
<br>leaving Clair in front. It was more a reflex than anything else. Normally he would rain down 
<br>punches, if they fucked up again. But she wasn't scared, not today. Why would she? That's why the 
<br>slap caught her off guard. "Who the fuck allowed you to go into a noble family's house to rob 
<br>them?" Another slap. Clair was so surprised, she didn't let out any sound. "Do you even know how 
<br>stupid that was? What do you think will happen now? They will just let it slide and not look for you 
<br>three? I don't think you were so smart to hide your faces, were you?"
<br>"Well no", Clair tried to explain, but another punch to her stomach wouldn't let her finish. She went 
<br>down to her knees and tried to moan, but the sound wouldn't come out.
<br>"I knew this was a horrible idea, to let you roam free. I thought you three couldn't fuck anything up 
<br>anymore than you usually do. Maybe get at least something for the whole crew, but what do I get? 
<br>Only fucking problems." Another kick to her side, she winced. What was going on? She didn't 
<br>understand. The plan was flawless, they got back with so much loot. With hundreds of thousand of 
<br>people living in Shima, how would they ever find them? He wasn't making sense. But before she 
<br>could even voice any concern, another hard kick hit her. She felt the familiar taste of blood in her 
<br>mouth.
<br>"That's quite enough", the mystery man said. A voice so deep it sounded unnatural, like something 
<br>from an old legend. Something from the realm of Gods.
<br>"Have a promised too much?" Morlan asked turning around to the stranger. Clair was trying to pick 
<br>herself up, touching her sides looking for serious injuries. She couldn't find any and spat out some 
<br>blood. She didn't need to look back, to know Zaran and Karan were cowering as far back as 
<br>possible. It was how things always went. She would take the brunt of Morlan's hits, but she could 
<br>take it. They couldn't.
<br>"It is indeed impressive", the stranger walked over to Clair. In the candle light a long, vertical scar 
<br>ran over his cheek. "I have to apologize for his behavior. Robbing the Azumaja family is overly 
<br>impressive, but in the future you won't have to do anything so dangerous anymore. How would you 
<br>like a change in profession?"
<br>"She has-", but Morlan was cut short by the raised hand of the stranger.
<br>He waited for an answer. "I don't understand. What kind of change?"
<br>"You will be working for Lady Sakara from now on. Your old boss and I have done a deal, you 
<br>won't be having to endure any more from him. Your new job will be quite different. But don't worry,
<br>Sakara will explain everything in great detail with you personally. You have ten minutes to pack 
<br>your bags and meet me downstairs. Don't be late, it's something Sakara will make you remember 
<br>quickly."
<br>Everything was happening too fast. "What about my brother? What about-"
<br>"We have already discussed your brother. What was his name? Ah yes, San. He will be joining you 
<br>and live with you in your new home. You two will be having your own room, separate beds, daily 
<br>baths, two warm meals a day and many more luxuries. Of course, under the condition of you 
<br>working up to Sakara's standards."
<br>Away from this flee hole? There must be something wrong about this. Nobody gives out free meals 
<br>and baths for total strangers. Clair couldn't get head around it. "What will be my work about?" she 
<br>asked shyly.
<br>Morlan laughed behind the stranger, "We will clear up any questions, when we get there. Now, pack
<br>your bags. I don't want to have to repeat myself again, or we will have some problems."
<br>Clair wanted to ask something else, but she didn't dare. The eyes of the stranger left no more room 
<br>for questions. She had no other choice and turned around. The two brothers looked at her with 
<br>anxious and puzzled faces and she thought Zaran had wet eyes when she walked passed them out 
<br>the door into her unknown life.<br></p>
