            <p>Chapter 9
<br>
<br>
<br>It was hard for the Professor to see her like this. Clair was given a spot on a caravan wagon to lie 
<br>and recover since the lightning storm. They had gotten some ointments from the border base they 
<br>passed through into the grasslands. These were of little use, generic mixtures of plants and oils the 
<br>Professor had seen thousands of times. Their potency was low, but he had no way of getting 
<br>anything better out here. Even in Shima it was hard to get anything against lightning wounds. For 
<br>starters, they were so rare, there simply wasn't a market for them. The few people who actually had 
<br>something to help against the burns and shakes were selling it at an astronomical price, but he 
<br>would have given every last gold piece he had. Seeing Clair like this broke his heart.
<br>Her left arm was completely covered with burn marks and bruises form the impact. The bolt had hit 
<br>her hand first, which you could see quite clearly from the sprawling pattern it drew on her skin. If it 
<br>wasn't so serious, the Professor would have called it quite beautiful, but there was no beauty in a 
<br>wound like this. The skin was either burned to a deep red or a mixture of purple and yellow. 
<br>Through all of that was a sprawling network of little lines and swirls, so fine in detail it was hard 
<br>not admire the intricacy of it. The Professor had never seen a wound like this before, the only 
<br>people he had seen, who had been hit by lightning bolts, were completely unrecognizable from their
<br>burns. He wouldn't even go so far and call them people anymore, because they had to collect the 
<br>different limbs and pieces of their bodies, which were scattered all over the place. The lightnings 
<br>were unforgiving.
<br>So it wasn't surprising the other travelers had a different opinion towards Clair now. For the 
<br>Professor it was a miracle she was still alive and breathing, even though her body was still fighting 
<br>to stay that way. For the others it was unnatural. Nobody survived the lightnings if they weren't a 
<br>Charged and then it didn't face them at all. A survivor of a lightning impact was unheard of, 
<br>impossible for all and beyond anything good. They were shunning them, scowling at them, some 
<br>even going so far to leave them behind to walk on their own without any supplies. So easily they 
<br>forgot who had saved their lives during the thunderstorm. If it hadn't for him, they would all look 
<br>far worse than Clair.
<br>She turned around and opened her eyes. She looked weak and had lost a lot of weight already. The 
<br>Professor quickly grabbed a ladle of water, which he had put in some sugar to give her just a little 
<br>bit of energy. "Take a sip, please", he said. She did so, slowly but drank the full ladle.
<br>"How late is it?" she asked.
<br>"We are going to stop soon, I think. I should be around seven or eight, if I am not mistaken. How 
<br>are you feeling?"
<br>"Stop asking me this, please. You know well enough I just feel weak and nauseous. I still don't feel 
<br>any pain nor will I ever do so. Stop worrying about it. It looks worse than it is."
<br>"It is way more serious and worse than you think it is. If you stay like this and can't keep food 
<br>down, because your body is revolting, you will simply starve to death."
<br>She waved for another ladle of water, "I can imagine worse deaths than this. In any case, it's either 
<br>here and now or later from the plague, so what's the big difference."
<br>"I see you are being quite the optimist today."
<br>"When am I not?" she tried to smile, but failed miserably. Her eyes were sunken deep into their 
<br>sockets and the color of her skin and changed from a beautiful brown into an ugly mix of brown, 
<br>yellow and green even.
<br>Aratos, who was at the front of the caravan only a couple of wagons away from them, signaled for 
<br>them to halt and the whole succession came to a rolling, slow halt. He had picked a flat piece of 
<br>land next to the road, well the dirt path really, to camp for the night. Preparing everything for the 
<br>night has become routine to everybody by this point. The wagons were rolled close together at the 
<br>eastern side of the camp to shield them against the winds, at least a little. Then everybody was 
<br>building up their tents for the night and would come together to prepare food. The Professor spotted
<br>Calandi leading some bulls to their pen, she looked over to him and smile half-heartedly. It didn't 
<br>bother him much how everybody treated them, but somehow it hurt a little seeing her keeping her 
<br>distance as well. He understood of course, she couldn't stand against the whole group, too, 
<br>especially being one of the leaders, but still. The biggest surprise was Deko though. Not only did he
<br>not care much about any curse, but he openly defended Clair, when the men tried to attack them 
<br>physically. Who would have guessed Deko would stand between them.
<br>"Can you help me?" Clair asked from the side and he turned around quickly. He helped her down 
<br>from the wagon feeling her cold, small hand in his. "I got some optimism for you. Did you see me 
<br>sleep back then? Like a little baby, almost never waking up at all. Isn't that something?"
<br>"It doesn't count if you are too exhausted to panic, Clair", he said instead. He grabbed their tent and 
<br>walked away from the group, who were setting up next to the wagons. It was a luxury they had to 
<br>give up, like so many others. Deko walked over to them, smoking another cigar. He must have some
<br>secret stash somewhere on the wagons. If he could find them, there were so many possibilities. But 
<br>then again, it wouldn't be nice to prank someone, who was their only ally left in this caravan. Was 
<br>this really enough to excuse the things he had done before?
<br>"I see you have finally stopped acting like a frightened child around me", he said looking at Clair.
<br>"I am simply too exhausted to care anymore, Deko. But if you put a hand on me, you will see how 
<br>much strength I have still left when I tear the skin off your face."
<br>He laughed and had to cough, "It's really a shame. I am beginning to actually like you, girl. 
<br>Anyways, I have come with rather bad news."
<br>"It's hard to make things worse, but I am listening", the Professor said.
<br>"Well, they can't let us starve out here or leave us behind, not to me at least and I am ordered to 
<br>keep you safe. As long as I am alive you are alright, but I had to make some compromises."
<br>"This sounds promising", Clair snarked.
<br>"From now on, you will be traveling on a wagon at the end of the caravan, with a little distance 
<br>between you and the next one. Be happy that I got you a wagon at all. Also, she is not allowed to 
<br>come near the others in the camp, nor the fires. We two are allowed to get food from there, but we 
<br>are also not allowed to stay. Quite a shame, I loved the warm atmosphere between those bums. 
<br>Anyways, keep your distance or it can get ugly. A royal seal will get you far, but a lot can happen 
<br>out here, lots of ways for me to die without raising any suspicion back in Shima, if you understand."
<br>"And there was I, looking forward to something like that happening and now I have to hope it won't
<br>happen at all?" Clair said. "You were right, these aren't good news."
<br>"How do you do it, professor?" he asked laughing. "How do you get her to like you?"
<br>"Well, for starters I didn't bring her into slavery or killed her brother." Clair tensed up next to him. 
<br>Did he went too far?
<br>Deko's laugh died and he took a drag from his cigar. "The boy isn't dead."
<br>"Are you sure about that?"
<br>He paused and locked eyes with the Professor. The evening light made it hard to make out more 
<br>than shapes, but the embers from his cigar illuminated his face a little. "It wasn't my fault. I was 
<br>following-"
<br>"Cut it out", Clair shouted. "Both of you. Deko, I know you have done good the last weeks for me, 
<br>but by the Gods I will rip you apart if you say another word." He looked at them, blew out some 
<br>smoke, but left without another word.
<br>"Clair, I am sorry. I shouldn't-"
<br>"I need some space", Clair snapped. "Don't follow me." And with that she went off into the darkness
<br>away from the camp.
<br>"Don't go too far", he shouted after her and felt an uneasy feeling in his stomach. He shouldn't have 
<br>said these things.
<br>#
<br>Clair was walking away from the busy camp into the darkness of the night. The sun had gone down 
<br>so quickly, it's almost like the night was stronger out here than in Shima. Having only seen a big 
<br>city and a few smaller towns with her family, traveling through the grasslands was a surreal 
<br>experience. They were so empty. Nothing was happening, it was all flat and overgrown with all 
<br>sorts of different grasses. Even a few bushes were something quite special out here and trees were 
<br>so rare she didn't know if she had actually seen one during the trip or if she hallucinated it. She had 
<br>heard from stories there were giant herds of wild cattle roaming the grasslands and the people were 
<br>living off them completely almost. But so far, only emptiness seemed to roam the grasslands.
<br>"Clair", a quiet voice cried from the side. She had seen and especially heard much from San these 
<br>last weeks. The fever wasn't helping with it. Not only was she reliving so many memories in her 
<br>dreams, but even when she was awake he was always there now. Back in Shima living with the 
<br>Professor she had been thinking less and less about her brother. She hadn't given up on him, not in 
<br>the slightest, but at least she could sleep without constant dreaming about him. But as soon as she 
<br>left the high walls of Shima her head wasn't working right anymore. "Where are you?" he asked the 
<br>wind distorting his gentle voice.
<br>"I am here, San", she whispered and walked on into the open wanting to be swallowed completely 
<br>by the darkness. The burn wound on her left arm was itching terribly, but she was fighting the urge. 
<br>The Professor had said it would make things worse and maybe even kill her. An infection out here 
<br>with no herbs and medicine could be fatal. It was almost unbearable though. Her skin was 
<br>screaming to be peeled away. It felt like something had crept underneath it, rummaging through her 
<br>insides. The Professor had also said, it felt quite hot, so she had to change dressings every now and 
<br>then to cool it down.
<br>It felt like she had walked for ever, but when she turned around she could still see the flames of the 
<br>camp dance in the night and paint eerie shadows from the travelers. Her body felt weak and even 
<br>the small distance had brought her to a point of exhaustion she hadn't anticipated. Slowly she went 
<br>down to her knees and prodded the ground to see if it was safe to sit on. She flattened a small area 
<br>of grass and finally sat down with a satisfied exhale. Hundreds of stars were shining over her head 
<br>and the two moons, both barely illuminated, were almost touching. Clair always thought it was sad 
<br>how close the two moons came to each other every couple of weeks, but they never touched and 
<br>probably never will. Maybe they were simply too shy to make the last step towards each other, too 
<br>afraid of what might happen.
<br>"I didn't know you liked me so much", a raspy voice said from her right. It made her jump, but she 
<br>recognized the deep, dark sound of Deko's voice immediately. It was hard to forget it.
<br>"I didn't know you were here", she answered into the darkness. She could barely see her own hand 
<br>before her eyes, but his voice sounded so near.
<br>"Don't expect me to move places, just because you happen to wander to the same place as me. If 
<br>you want to be alone, walk on."
<br>It was hard not to want to move away from him, just leave him alone in the darkness and find 
<br>someplace else. But her body was screaming to her, she should stay where she was. She needed the 
<br>rest badly, her body felt barely strong enough to sit upright. Walking away would just mean more 
<br>exhaustion.
<br>"It's fine I suppose", she said instead. "But can you show me where you are somehow?"
<br>She heard a rustling from Deko's side and a blue light appeared only a couple of meters besides 
<br>Clair. He had pulled out a charged sapphire, barely holding any lightning anymore. The dim light 
<br>was enough though, to make out where he was. His hair seemed to have grayed with the sapphire 
<br>light and the scar on his cheek was somehow glowing slightly. "Still so afraid of me, little girl?"
<br>"Wouldn't you?" she asked. "I guess it's not your fault entirely, but I associate a lot of shit that 
<br>happened to me with you. I guess you can understand that."
<br>"We all have our demons, yours just happens to have my face." He put back the sapphire in one of 
<br>his bags, concealing the light completely and plunging them back into darkness. Somehow it wasn't 
<br>making her more scared, now that she couldn't see what he was doing anymore. If Clair was honest,
<br>she was weirdly enough, not scared at all. Maybe too exhausted to be scared anymore.
<br>"Can I ask you something?"
<br>"I hate it when people ask that. Ask the question or don't. Stop poking around trying to be 
<br>considerate or something. Don't beat around the bush."
<br>"Alright, why are you here, Deko? I mean really here. They don't want to protect the Professor from
<br>anything out here. Soruma would be delighted if something would happen to him out here. So 
<br>what's the deal?"
<br>"A man gotta eat", Deko muttered.
<br>"Well I didn't actually expect an answer, but don't think I am not onto you."
<br>"You can barely walk or eat anything solid and in a few weeks you will be dead, little girl. You are 
<br>good at talking big, but you have nothing behind it. If I wanted to, you two would already be dead. I
<br>am not good at a lot of things, but killing and fighting is something I am decent enough to beat a 
<br>little girl and a scholar. Even if he is rather tall for a robed one."
<br>Sadly, he was right. She was good at talking big, but had nothing, absolutely nothing to put against 
<br>him. Taking hits and punches was something she had been able to endure pretty damn well her 
<br>whole life and it was sometimes enough. Even that has brought her more pain than the actual hits 
<br>would have been though.
<br>The two sat in silence for a while. The other travelers had begun to sing songs to pass the time and 
<br>get morale back up probably.
<br>"Deko", Clair began slowly, "what happened to the others when I left?" It was a question she had 
<br>asked herself hundreds or thousands of times since that day. It had been a ruthless decision and on 
<br>some days she regretted it deeply, but it was necessary and she would do the same again if faced 
<br>with the same decision. It had still hurt these last two years.
<br>"What do you think happened? It's not like you cared about it, did you?"
<br>"Of course I cared what happened to them. I cared for them more than you will ever do. Don't talk 
<br>to me like that, you know nothing what we have been through because of people like Sakara. While 
<br>you were leaning on walls, watching us or running some errands we were forced to sell our bodies 
<br>and more. You will understand the bond we formed because of it. So, don't talk to me about caring. 
<br>I just want to know what happened. Can you at least be a decent person for once and tell me."
<br>"A decent person wouldn't tell you about it, little girl. And it's not important now, is it? It has 
<br>happened, they moved on, you moved on and things are back to normal. Nothing you can do about 
<br>it now, so what's the big deal?"
<br>If she had any strength left in her body or knew she could actually inflict any amount of pain to 
<br>him, she wouldn't have needed to think about it for a second. "Maybe I should have stayed", she 
<br>whispered more to herself than anybody else. Speaking so loudly has left her mouth dry and she felt
<br>how little she had drunk today again.
<br>"It wasn't that bad. You know she couldn't do anything to them, they are her capital. It couldn't be 
<br>something visible, so that rules out quite a lot of horrible things."
<br>"Are you trying to make me feel better about it? Because you are doing a horrible job at him. I am 
<br>no naive child anymore. I know Sakara and I know the things she can do to people. She had 
<br>something on all of them, otherwise they would have left quicker than you can light a new cigar. 
<br>She knew things about every one of us, things we thought were our little deep, dark secrets. And I 
<br>left them behind with her." The words sounded bitter in her mouth. She felt tears forming in her 
<br>eyes and the area between her chest and stomach seemed to sink deeper inside.
<br>"They are alright", he said and his voice sounded raspier than normal. "Don't stay out here for too 
<br>long, the air is getting cold and you are too weak to catch a cold as well." The grass rustled where 
<br>Deko said, he probably stood up and then she heard quiet foot steps leaving her alone with the stars 
<br>and moons.
<br>It took her hours to get back to the camp. The fires had almost all died down and most of the 
<br>travelers were already sleeping in their tents. Only the night watch was still awake, some sitting 
<br>around a single fire, the others patrolling the perimeter. Luck for her, the Professor had built their 
<br>tent quite a way away from the camp. Even further than he had to do, so she didn't run into any of 
<br>them directly. She didn't like the idea of being alone in the dark with one of them. Lonely men, who
<br>were angry were the most dangerous ones of them all. And these men were getting restless already.
<br>She crawled into the tent, noticing the familiar snore of the Professor. For a moment she was hurt, 
<br>that he didn't stay up to see if she was alright and getting back to the tent at all, but then his 
<br>silhouette turned around and the snoring stopped instantly. He was faking it.
<br>"Get under a blanket quickly, please", he said gently and handed her one of their wool blankets. She
<br>wrapped herself in it and lay down beside him. "Clair", he began, but stopped.
<br>"You don't have to say anything, I know."
<br>"Do you want to come closer?" he asked.
<br>Instead of answering him, she shuffled over, because she felt the tears coming already. He put his 
<br>arm around her and she put her head on his chest. As soon as she felt the familiar warmth and felt 
<br>the safety of his arm around her, she wasn't able to hold it back anymore. The tears came streaming 
<br>and she started sobbing uncontrollable.<br></p>
