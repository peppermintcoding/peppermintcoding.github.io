            <p>Chapter 2
<br>
<br>
<br>Clair was leaning against the house wall with her hood up hiding her face. She was waiting 
<br>patiently for Karan and Zaran, but her patience was running thin. Their plan was highly dependent 
<br>on timing and they couldn't afford to be late. The boys were late though. She crouched down when 
<br>she saw one of the street dogs approaching through the little alley way she was waiting. The houses 
<br>here were standing close and blocked out much of the sun. A chilly wind was blowing through the 
<br>city and it wasn't stopped by the houses at all. The dog wailed his tail when noticing Clair and ran 
<br>up to her. It was the one with black fur and white dots. He was looking strong and well fed, she was 
<br>glad.
<br>"Come here, good boy", she said and petted his ears with both her hands. She would have given him
<br>or any of the other dogs names, but it was harder when they stopped appearing in the streets and 
<br>were named. So she stopped quite some time ago to give them too much weight. It wasn't keeping 
<br>her from caring for them, so she reached into her satchel dangling from her side and took out a 
<br>piece of dried meat. The dog sniffed the air and turned around to see what she had in her hand. 
<br>Hastily and without much regards for her fingers, he bit down on it. "Careful, careful", but it was in 
<br>vain, it always was. You couldn't teach someone raised on the streets any manners. It went for dogs 
<br>just as for humans.
<br>"What is taking them so long?" She had no clock on her and even if she had the big and clunky 
<br>things would have just been in her way. But the sun was already high up in the sky and their target 
<br>was quite a few blocks away from where they had meant to meet up.
<br>Quick steps echoing from the walls came from down the alley way. If it's not them, we are fucked, 
<br>she thought. But as she saw it was Karan turning around the corner with his brother in tow she 
<br>relaxed a little for the first time today. At least the first step went well, even though they had to 
<br>make up some time.
<br>"It took you long enough", she said with an angry undertone. She stood up and the dog hid behind 
<br>her legs. Apparently the two boys were scaring the little guy, how adorable.
<br>"Sorry, Clair", Zaran apologized, breathing heavily, "but we were having some trouble snatching the
<br>uniforms. It's like someone is trying to tell us it's a bad plan. They started washing the uniforms at 
<br>least half an hour later than we normally observed in the last week. Isn't that a sign, Clair?"
<br>Why were they all so superstitious? She wasn't sure of many things in life, but one thing was clear: 
<br>the Gods weren't interesting in little street rats as themselves and definitely wouldn't send them 
<br>convoluted signs like making them wait for the uniforms like this to tell them some secret message 
<br>of how stupid their plan was. Or how stupid her plan was, maybe she didn't want to admit that. "But
<br>you all three of them?" They both nodded. Both weren't the luckiest boys in Shima. Lots of tiny red 
<br>pimples scarred their faces and both their noses were broken so often, that is was a miracle they 
<br>could even still smell something. It made them horribly croaked though. "And you got the right 
<br>sizes, right? It will look overly suspicious if our uniforms don't fit right. This plan hinges on the 
<br>details, guys."
<br>"We got it all, trust us", Karan said with an annoyed looked on his face. He didn't like getting 
<br>bossed around by her. Which was not too surprising. She was barely half their weight and a couple 
<br>years younger. But even if he didn't like it, he was smart enough to follow her, because that's how 
<br>they got their money.
<br>"Let's got then", she said and they moved quickly down the alley to do the second step in her plan. 
<br>They were going to rob a nobles household today, and nothing could go wrong or it would be more 
<br>than just a beating and some kicks in the stomach from Morlan this time.
<br>#
<br>Luck was back on their side and Clair hoped it would give Zaran and Karan a reason to stop 
<br>worrying about their superstitions. Entering one of the nobles districts was forbidden for any people
<br>not part of the upper class, but today the patrols of soldiers were nowhere to be seen. She had 
<br>picked the Azumaja manor for a variety of reasons, but one was, it was near the districts edge, 
<br>which would give them a perfect exit route and hopefully let them find cover.
<br>The lavish upper districts were not only different because of their giant manors and personal 
<br>soldiers, but there were dozens of little forests with lakes, creeks and ponds. "Let's hide behind this 
<br>boulder over here", Clair said to the brothers and they followed her. It wasn't long now before the 
<br>service maids form Mother Kanoshi's cleaning service would cross through this little forest on their 
<br>way from another noble man's manor to the Azumaja family. Clair was getting giddy again and was 
<br>playing with her hair tips. She needed to wash it again soon, it was matted and oily. Zaran often 
<br>suggested cutting it short for it being more convenient and easier to take care of, but she loved her 
<br>long hair. Even if it was taking more time and effort to keep in shape, she wasn't giving up her 
<br>mother's beautiful black hair. She hadn't much to remember her by.
<br>"Did you get the lockpicks?" Karan asked.
<br>"Of course", Zaran answered annoyed, "you know I packed them in. Right in-" This wasn't a good 
<br>sign. He was frantically going through his pockets, turning them inside out, but nothing dropped out
<br>other than some food, crumbs and dirt.
<br>Karan hit his brother on the back of his head, "You idiot. How are we supposed to open anything 
<br>without lockpicks?"
<br>"It's not my fault. Why did I have to bring them with me in the first place? I was in charge of getting
<br>the uniforms? What have you done until now?"
<br>"Keep your voices down", Clair cautioned them. "Do you want a patrol to find us and throw us into 
<br>a prison for a week?" Clair opened her satchel and took out two complete lockpick sets for both of 
<br>them. Somehow she knew they would forget. "Put them somewhere, where you can get to them 
<br>quickly, but also somewhere, where from the outside they are not visible. And let's put on the 
<br>uniforms before they get here."
<br>"You are a life save as usual, Clair", Zaran said with a smile and even Karan thanked her. They 
<br>changed into the uniforms, stashing their old clothes under some yellow and red leaves, which were 
<br>plenty in autumn. The boys peeked at her periodically while changing, but Clair didn't mind. It 
<br>wasn't anything special by now. Living in a lair with dozens of young thieves, privacy wasn't 
<br>something one had.
<br>The clothes fit alright, but her pants were a bit too short. The boots she were wearing should cover 
<br>it up well enough she hoped. But if everything went to plan they only had to fool some overworked 
<br>guards at the main gate.
<br>"They are coming", Karan whispered ducking down behind the boulder. Two boys and one girl were
<br>coming closer wearing the same uniform as they were now, pulling a little wagon behind them. 
<br>Within they had stashed all sorts of cleaning utensils like mobs, special liquid to polish all sorts of 
<br>surfaces, oils for the wood and other random bits and pieces. It was where they would hide their 
<br>stolen goods, walking right out the front door with nobody noticing.
<br>Clair got out a little bottle with a yellow liquid inside. She also took out three pieces of cloth and 
<br>put some of the liquid on it. "Don't breathe it in", she explained them again. "Press it against their 
<br>noses quickly and hold it there until you can feel their bodies go limp. It will only take a few 
<br>seconds."
<br>"Do I want to ask where you got this stuff?" Karan asked with raised eyebrows, but Clair didn't 
<br>answer and gave them both one of the cloths. The three targets were getting close enough now, so 
<br>she gave the boys a nod and they jumped from behind the boulder. It was a quick struggle, but they 
<br>were no match. Zaran and Karan were big boys for their age and had no problem overwhelming 
<br>their counterparts and the girl was no match for a street bred thief like Clair. The three employees 
<br>from Mother Kanoshi were barely any older than them. Clair punched the girl right in the stomach 
<br>and heard the air escape her body. After that she put the cloth on her nose and the body went limp in
<br>seconds. They quickly stashed the bodies behind the boulder but only before going through all of 
<br>their pockets until finally finding theri scroll of passage. They carefully covered them with more of 
<br>the leaves, trying to make it look as natural as possible. But hopefully they were gone as soon as 
<br>someone noticed them or they woke up from their slumber.
<br>"And this will keep them down for how long?" Karan asked.
<br>"Long enough hopefully", Clair answered and started walking towards the Asumaja manor. "We 
<br>have no time for smalltalk, let's get going guys. Stage three of the plan, infiltration."
<br>#
<br>After a couple of minutes the forest was getting lighter and the manor rose before them out from the
<br>ground like a giant castle. It had strong stone walls all around with spiked on top to prevent people 
<br>from easily climbing them. The main gate was just ahead, guarded by four private guards wearing 
<br>the family crest of the Azumaja family, a red ship with two masts, on their armored chests. Long red
<br>capes were flapping in the wind and with their short swords at their side, they were quite 
<br>intimidating.
<br>"Stay calm and remember your lines", she encouraged the two boys. And herself a bit as well. 
<br>"They have no reason to suspect anything from us. It's not unusual for Kanoshi to send different 
<br>people to clean different houses."
<br>"Finally", one of the guards exclaimed overly loud. "We were awaiting you almost an hour ago."
<br>"Our apologies", Clair answered quickly, looking towards the ground, "we were held up by our last 
<br>employer. It took a little bit longer this time. We are also doing some restructuring at our business. It
<br>won't happen another time, I can assure your Master."
<br>"Look, it's a Maru girl", one of the other guards exclaimed. He had a sly grin, messy and oily hair 
<br>and big bags under his eyes. "Maybe you can come to my house and do some cleaning there too, if 
<br>you know what I mean?" It got a big laugh from the other three guards.
<br>"If you that's all we would like to get to work", Karan intercepted. "As you said, we are already late 
<br>and I don't think Master Azumaja will be happy when he comes back from the theater and we are 
<br>still roaming inside his house. I sure don't want to be punished for something, that isn't my fault."
<br>"Right, right", the first guard said, probably the captain. "Utensils are in the basement, just left after 
<br>the entrance. You got all your instructions of what rooms are off limit and which are to be cleaned?"
<br>Off limit rooms? This was new information. "Of course we are", Karan answered with confidence. 
<br>"What kind of business do you think Mother Kanoshi runs? We are professionals and not some 
<br>second grade cleaning crew." Don't overdo it, Clair begged him in her thoughts and shot him a 
<br>glance, but he didn't look at her.
<br>"Alright, little man", the first guard said. "Go ahead." They made way and the two guards, who 
<br>hadn't spoken yet, opened the big iron, spiky gate. They were in. They didn't even want to see the 
<br>scroll of passage, which was needed to enter the district without being a member of the nobles. 
<br>Everything went according to her plan, but it was too early to celebrate. As soon as they had some 
<br>distance between themselves and the group of guards, Clair began to go through the plan again. The
<br>main entrance of the house itself was still a hundred meters or so away from the main gate. So much
<br>unused space, but down at the harbor people were desperate to get some place to sleep.
<br>Zaran was pulling the little wagon and Clair cautioned them about some details of the plan. Don't 
<br>steal anything what would be noticed by random guards walking around the manor on their patrols. 
<br>Nothing too personal, because it would arise suspicion when selling it or was too dangerous to even 
<br>bring to the shadiest merchants. Nothing with charged sapphires. Even though the Azumaja family 
<br>probably had quite the delicate collection of large pieces of sapphires who could hold more 
<br>lightning charge, the risk was too high. If you were silent you could hear them make a crackling 
<br>sound and the light they gave off could also reveal them. Everything had to be perfect. The guards 
<br>would not have mercy with them.
<br>The boys nodded towards Clair, and they arrived at the front door. They carried the wagon up the 
<br>couple of stairs, two guards opening up the front doors, which swung open and revealed a 
<br>miraculous inside. The floor was sparkling with tiny blue charged sapphires covering the whole 
<br>lobby. Glass was covering the sapphires and gave light to a white marble, which was used all over 
<br>the manor. The stairs had thick carpets, in the main color of the house, red, and the railings were 
<br>depictions of animals fighting against each other. There were even animals from Clair's homeland: 
<br>mighty lions ripping apart gazelles, rhinos charging ahead or elephants fleeing. Most impressive of 
<br>all this luxury, was the giant chandelier hanging from the high ceiling in the middle of the lobby. It 
<br>must contain dozens if not hundreds of charged sapphires. All perfectly round spheres hanging from
<br>golden chains. It was buzzing and crackling in an intensity Clair had never heard before from any 
<br>charged sapphire. It must be worth more than anything she had ever put her eyes on before. Sadly, 
<br>they couldn't steal it so she refocused herself and cleared her mind.
<br>The two brothers weren't any different, looking at the inside with open mouths. "Stop looking like 
<br>street kids seeing a manor for the first time", Clair said to them.
<br>"You look just the same to me to be honest", Karan countered.
<br>"Let's not fight", his brother said, "we have a job to do and I want this done as quickly as possible. I 
<br>have a bad feeling all of the sudden. This is way too dangerous. What have you gotten us into 
<br>Clair?"
<br>"I have gotten us into one of the richest houses of Shima. Do you think we can clear our debt with 
<br>Morlan by stealing from some random stranger? Not anymore."
<br>"Alright", he conceded.
<br>"Let's start with the dining room. There should be a lot of silver and golden forks and knives for us 
<br>to grab", Clair grinned. It was satisfying when a plan was working out. They would not only clear 
<br>their debt, but could live for a bit without having to risk their lives on these heists. Maybe it would 
<br>even give them some safety from Morlan's fury. You are not there yet, Clair reminded herself.
<br>Zaran pulled the little wagon with them into the dining room, which was located in the right wing of
<br>the building. Clair had done some work to uncover the overall structure of the manor. They would 
<br>also hit the upper floor where the Lady Azumaja and her daughters had their bedrooms. Lots of 
<br>expensive jewelry was waiting to fill their pockets.
<br>The hallways were decorated with oil paintings of the lineage of the house's history and prior 
<br>Masters, or so she guessed. Of whom else would you hang paintings of in your hallway? But to be 
<br>honest, Clair didn't understand it anyways. All it does was feel empty in here. The only thing she 
<br>heard were their foot steps and her pounding heart. What a waste.
<br>When she opened the double door towards the dining room she felt her heart stop for a couple of 
<br>beats. On the head of the giant table a boy was sitting eating some desserts. What was he doing 
<br>here? The boys stumbled against here because Clair had frozen right in her tracks. The boy turned 
<br>around looking right at her.
<br>"Hello", he said. He had short brown hair, warm brown eyes and was wearing a simple black shirt 
<br>with golden buttons. A fire crackled on the far end of the room in a enormous fireplace, burning 
<br>through a days worth of wood for a normal family in half an hour.
<br>"Apologies, Master", Karan said, bowing and his brother did the same. He had to gently hit her 
<br>before she finally bowed down herself. She had to focus. They had to change a bit about their plan 
<br>and be more careful, but this could still work. Maybe one of them had to distract the boy so the 
<br>others had free roam.
<br>He stood up from his place and strolled over. Only a noble man's son could exude this amount of 
<br>confidence with only his style of walking. Every step was taking like he owned the world himself. 
<br>Nobody owed him anything and he could do everything. He stood for everything Clair was 
<br>disgusted with. He was the reason they were in this trouble. If she just would have been fine with 
<br>robbing random families or merchants. But every time they vetted some potential targets she got 
<br>cold feet and blew it off for some idiotic reason, covering up for the fact, that she couldn't bring 
<br>herself to taking from the people who had just enough for themselves. Because of the high taxes, 
<br>most of the money went to great houses of the nobles. It went to him.
<br>"We didn't know anybody was home", Clair said getting her composure back. "If you excuse us, we 
<br>will start in a different room if that is alright with you?"
<br>"Tell me", he said instead, "where are you from?" He was standing now just in front of Clair.
<br>"Sorry?"
<br>"I want to know where you are from?"
<br>"I am Maru", she replied staring him right into the eyes. You weren't suppose to look a superior into 
<br>the eyes, but she couldn't help herself. Who does he think he is?
<br>"You two", he pointed at Zaran and Karan. "You can start upstairs with the bed rooms. My sisters 
<br>made quite a mess out of the bathrooms up there, they need some extra attention. Would you like to 
<br>sit for a minute or two", he said turning back towards Clair.
<br>"Sit? Master I am sorry, but I don't understand. I came here to work and not to entertain your 
<br>afternoon. Mother Kanoshi won't be happy if she hears I am not doing my job."
<br>"Well, you can either sit with me and risk the fury of this Kanushi person you are speaking of", he 
<br>strolled over to the table again. This arrogant walk. "Or you can go upstairs with the other two and I
<br>will have to tell my father, what a horrible job you did today. Also, being rude to the Master of the 
<br>house will not sit right with my father. He is very, let's say, conservative in that regard."
<br>Clair hesitated for a moment trying to find a way out of this situation. But this was the best option 
<br>they had. She would be able to distract him and the other two were busy robbing the upstairs clean. 
<br>They just needed to somehow get out without this boy noticing anything. She walked over, and the 
<br>boy held back a chair for her to sit on. She sat down and he brought her a plate with a sweet piece of
<br>cake. It looked like chocolate, something she had never tasted before, but heard enough about. It 
<br>was reserved for the upper class, like so many things.
<br>"It's alright. You can eat", he said laughing, "I won't tell. It can be our little secret, alright?"
<br>Without another though she grabbed the cake with her hand and took a big bite. The taste was so 
<br>sweet she instantly felt sick. It was so moist and sweet, but also a little bitter. This was what 
<br>everybody was getting crazy over?
<br>The boy laughed, "You normally take one of these", holding out a fork for her. It was made from 
<br>silver with gold embellishments, probably worth enough for Clair to feast for a week. She took it, a 
<br>little ashamed for being so crude eating with her hands like she normally did. "What's your name?"
<br>"Why does it interest you?"
<br>He grinned. "You know, normally people don't talk back like this to me. If I ask, you answer. Let's 
<br>try this again, what's your name?"
<br>Little arrogant bastard. "Clair", she said trying another piece of the cake. It was still bad.
<br>"That's not a Maru name is it?"
<br>"You are weirdly interested in one of your cleaning ladies, aren't you? My mother used to say, it's 
<br>not very polite to pelt a woman with questions, if you haven't even told her your name first."
<br>That stupid giant grin on his face, he seemed to enjoy himself splendidly, "Alright, Clair", he 
<br>pronounced her name overly dramatic, "my name is Sali Azumaja, heir of the Azumaja family and 
<br>in a few months I will come of age and will have control over half the wealth of our family, which 
<br>will make me one of the richest young men in the whole nation."
<br>"You say it like it's something impressive you should be proud of", Clair said and froze when she 
<br>noticed she said it out loud and not just in her head. Right now, he was enjoying himself and nice to 
<br>her, but it could change quite quickly with these nobles. They don't do well with disrespect. Clair 
<br>looked up from her plate, chewing on the last bite of her cake. It was getting worse with every bite. 
<br>To her surprise he didn't look angry, a little confused maybe, but also interested.
<br>"Can you explain what you mean?" he said and the confidence aura was beginning to crumble.
<br>Be careful Clair, she cautioned herself. "Please forgive me, I shouldn't have said any of this. My 
<br>mother always told me I shouldn't run my mouth so much, but sometimes I can't control myself. It 
<br>won't happen again."
<br>"Don't do that. You have nothing to fear from me. I really want to know what you mean with what 
<br>you said. Why wouldn't it be impressive to be one of the richest people in the world?"
<br>Clair looked up into his warm eyes, "I just don't understand why you boast about something you did
<br>nothing to earn. I mean what did you really do for the wealth of your family? Be born? It's not 
<br>something I would be overly proud of."
<br>"So you think I don't deserve it?" he asked looking puzzled.
<br>Clair breathed in deep, "It's just something my father used to say a lot. That the nobles made their 
<br>wealth on the back of slaves back in the days and now they are making it because of the wealth they
<br>accumulated from them. They earn money from taxes, they own businesses, they give out loan. 
<br>Everything they can do is only because they have a large bag of money in their houses somewhere. 
<br>I think he was just angry about the fact, that he had to work for everything and you, well, you 
<br>inherited more than he could have ever made in a hundred life times."
<br>The following silence swallowed everything around them. For saying something like this he could 
<br>put her into custody and hold her for some period of time. Long enough for the robbery to be 
<br>noticed and she would have to take the fall for it. At least she hoped Zaran and Karan could escape 
<br>somehow before all that happened, with some loot to show for. Why, on this day of all the possible 
<br>days, was he at home and not with his family? They had watched the Azumaja family closely the 
<br>last few weeks and they always went together to the theater. Always. Sali's eyes were fixated on 
<br>Clair's. She wasn't sure what would happen now. Her heartbeat was thundering in her chest and her 
<br>hands were sweaty.
<br>"What do you think?" he asked instead. Hasn't she told him already?
<br>"What do you mean? Haven't I told you?"
<br>"No, actually you told me what your father said about it and it's quite interesting I have to admit. 
<br>We never talk like that about anything and especially not about our own wealth and family, but I am
<br>getting curious now. Do you agree with every word your father said or do you have a different point
<br>of few? Or even more interesting, what would you do in my position? Relinquish the whole wealth 
<br>and live as a, yes, as a what?"
<br>Clair thought about it for a moment before answering and Sali cut her another piece of this 
<br>disgusting chocolate cake and put it on her empty plate. She dug in immediately. "Yes, I would give 
<br>almost all the money away, only keeping enough to feed me and my family for the rest of our lives. 
<br>I would change things around the city. No person should be starving on the streets, nobody should 
<br>have to sleep together with eight other people in one room, just because you can't afford anything 
<br>better, while the noble families occupy this huge space inside the city. You have more bedrooms 
<br>than your parents could ever have kids. It's not fair and I wouldn't feel comfortable with it. How can
<br>you?"
<br>Behind his warm brown eyes something was moving. It wasn't his pupils or eyes as a whole, and it 
<br>wasn't even a change in color or something you could really put your finger on, but Clair was sure 
<br>something was happening behind these warm eyes. She took a closer look at his appearance and 
<br>was intrigued by his hands. They were absolutely clean. Not one grain of sand or dirt underneath his
<br>fingernails, no scar running along his long fingers, no burn marks, they were flawless and beautiful. 
<br>This was what a lifetime of wealth would buy you besides a giant manor and business empire: 
<br>impeccable hands.
<br>The soldier barging in through the double doors ripped her from her thoughts and even Sali seemed 
<br>startled like his thoughts were something he wasn't allowed to think about. "Forgive for the 
<br>intrusion, Master", the guard said hastily and bowed before the heir of the Azumaja family. He 
<br>wasn't one of the guards at the gate and nor one of the ones standing guard at the main entrance.
