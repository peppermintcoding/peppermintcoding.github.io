            <p>Chapter 8
<br>
<br>
<br>Malin woke from her sleep with a hand pressed hard on her lips. Unable to make a
<br>sound. Still dizzy from the sleep she tried to find out what was going on.
<br>"Don't  start  screaming  if I  let  go  of your  mouth,  understand?",  a  familar  voice
<br>whispered in her ear.
<br>Malina nodded slowly and the hand left her mouth. "What were you doing this for",
<br>Malina asked.
<br>"You were screaming in your sleep. I didn't want the whole camp to lose their sleep
<br>because you having a nightmare."
<br>"Oh." She felt embarassed. Aelana was getting up beside her, the light barely enough
<br>to see arm lengths in front of you. The rain had stopped.
<br>"You should go to the seamstress today and get yourself some clothing fit for the
<br>forest. With this tattered dress you will soon walk around naked." Aelana still sitting
<br>on her side of the small hut, she picked up a wodden item. Malina had never seen
<br>anything therelike. It was long and narrow, with a ball at one end. The ball had an
<br>openeing at the top where it was black like the night. The rest was of a shallow
<br>brown.
<br>"What is that", she asked and then added quickly, "If I may ask you a question."
<br>"Here is a little tip for you", she put dried leaves into the ball at the end, "If you want
<br>to survive and be fully acknowledged in this tribe, you need to act differently. Don't
<br>ask for permission to ask a question. Don't stare at people just because they are
<br>clothed differently than you. It's no crime to show some skin, even if it is your neck
<br>or breast."
<br>"Well, why don't you dress like the others", Malina responded. "I don't see you blend
<br>well with the other people here."
<br>Aelana brought her tinder to ignite with a wodded drill and lit the dry leaves inside.
<br>"We both might not dress like the others but we are not equals in this. I made a
<br>decision to dress the way I do. I see the custom and I acted against them because I
<br>wanted to. You don't decide to wear that piece of cloth around your neck. You accept
<br>the things like they are and don't try to change them at all. Not that there is ever a
<br>way to change things in this world, but that's beside the point." Aelana inhaled with
<br>the narrow piece between her lips and let out a big cloud of smoke. "It's a pipe, by the
<br>way."
<br>"I can make my own decisions", she said, her voice shaky. "You have no idea what I
<br>am capable of."
<br>"I don't? Well, why don't you proof me wrong than. Actions speak louder than
<br>words."
<br>"What if I choose to keep wearing something to cover my neck? You took away my
<br>choice in this. If I take your advice and change my clothing the way the others wear
<br>it, I would still simply follow a norm and not from my own choosing. If I don't
<br>change anything, I keep with the old. Is there even a choice to make, that is my own
<br>here?"
<br>Aelana laughed out loud and choked a bit on her smoke. "You are not as simple
<br>minded as I thought you be. Keep surprising me and I will actually want to remember
<br>your name."
<br>"Why wouldn't you want to remember my name?"
<br>She looked Malina straight in the eye. "You are not the first lowlander to seek exile in
<br>these woods. I am guilty of it myself. The only difference is, I know how to take care
<br>of myself. The others, not so much. So they either leave and crawl back to where they
<br>came from or they die quickly. Some because they can't hunt or forage enough, so the
<br>tribe will not feed them through, or because they get eaten by some vile creature. It's
<br>always the same. Nothing personal."
<br>Malina couldn't provide for herself. How could she? She was raised to be a lady who
<br>goes on balls and banquets. She was never to live alone without a father or husband.
<br>But she made a deal with Karman. She just needs to work on those stone tablets in
<br>exchange for shelter and food. Wasn't that the deal?
<br>"I made a deal with Karman", she said. "He wanted me to tell him what was written
<br>on the stone tablets. I won't need to go hunting to provide for myself."
<br>"The only way to provide for yourself without going into the woods is with your legs
<br>spread wide open and a fruitfull belly. Don't even think for a minute you can read
<br>what was written on those rainin' tablets. He is holding on to some old myth. Nobody
<br>can read them anymore. Or maybe noone ever could."
<br>"Apologies, but what did you say to me? I will not use my body and spirit to pay for
<br>my food and shelter. Is that what you think of me?"
<br>"I don't think about you at all, little bird. I will go now, hunting is always done best in
<br>the morning." Aelana picked her bow and the arrows from rack of weapons and made
<br>it out the opening.
<br>Her words gave Malina food for thought. Was it Karman's secret desire to get her to
<br>share his bed with him? Was he looking that way at her? She couldn't tell, she never
<br>could. A servant boy named Erin was once trying to get Malina's attention in that
<br>way. She didn't notice until her father chased him out of their house. He was always
<br>kind to her, looked her straight in the eyes with a bright smile. Wasn't Karman doing
<br>the same?
<br>No. She needed to stay focussed. Getting answers from the tablets would be enough
<br>for her to stay here. Where else would she go anyway?
<br>Crawling out of the hut, sun rays painting the forest in a warm light, Malina looked
<br>around her new found home. People were going about their daily business. Fire were
<br>ignited for cooking the breakfast, children running around and playing games. A
<br>couple of birds singing in the background.
<br>She made her way down from their tree home, down the wanky ladder, swaying little
<br>by little from side to side, but she made it safe down anyway. Finally with her boots
<br>on the ground she felt more safe and made her way towards Karman's eating circle.
<br>Like yesterday, the two woman and the shaven giant Choco were sitting by his side.
<br>One spot empty, for herself she hoped.
<br>"Do you mind if I join you?", she asked.
<br>"We were just waiting for you to arrive", Choco said with his deep voice. "How was
<br>your first night in this mysterious forest? Anything like sleeping at home?"
<br>"It was quite different from my former home." She tried to stress 'former'. "But it was
<br>quite alright, I feel refreshed and ready."
<br>Two men were bringing food to all of the eating circles, different ones than yesterday
<br>evening. Maybe they were rotating the responsibility or there were different people
<br>responsible for different meals.
<br>"I wish to talk with you about your work here", Karman said while he chewed on a
<br>piece of meat. Back at her father's house this would be unheard of. Speaking with a
<br>full mouth, a social suicide. "I want to extend your responsibility. I want you to teach
<br>our children to draw words and read them back. We discussed it yesterday eve and
<br>came to the conclusion it could be worthwhile for us."
<br>"So I will split my time from working with the tablets and teaching your children
<br>then?"
<br>"All children will come to you to learn during the early morning. After midday they
<br>will go about something else and you will have enough time to work on the tablets."
<br>"I guess you can't wait to finally know what they are saying, can you?", Choco asked.
<br>"I have waited long enough I think", Karman answered. "They hold answeres to a
<br>mystery older than we are, I know it. I lay all my hopes in your hands, Malina."
<br>Malina felt a lot hotter than she should have. The sun rays were bright but it was early
<br>morning. Her heart thumping in her chest. She was good at writing and reading, she
<br>read dozens of books from her father's library, but she didn't know if the tablets were
<br>written with the same system nor with the same language they were speaking.
<br>"I will do my very best to uphold your trust in me", she said to Karman and finally
<br>began to eat her breakfast. Besides meat there were berries again and an asortment of
<br>nuts and seeds. It dawned on her, that the food in the forest wasn't as diverse as back
<br>in Nigita. "How many children will I have for teaching?"
<br>"Three. The others are too small to learn yet or old enough to learn hunting and
<br>foraging. Gathering food will always have priority."
<br>The breakfast was done faster than the evemeals and there was no singing or loud
<br>converstation. Everybody was getting ready to leave the camp for the day and hunt in
<br>the woods. Malina made her way to Karman's hut, where the children should be
<br>waiting for her. When she finally climbed up the ladder, nobody was there. Malina
<br>started to panick. What if the children didn't want her to teach them? How should she
<br>act then? Force the children? But how so?
<br>She climbed back down, the camp already almost empty. Two men and a woman
<br>always stayed behind to guard the camp, they couldn' afford to leave more. They
<br>were climbing up the trees into their canopy or walking in a big circle around the
<br>camp, watching out for strangers. A woman was sitting outside with pieces of leather
<br>and cloth around her. She must be the seamstress. Malina walked over the clearing to
<br>talk to her.
<br>"Aplogies for interrupting your work", Malina said. "I am Malina."
<br>"Oh I know who you are", the woman smiled at her. A bone needle in one hand and a
<br>thread in the other. Her hair was long and in braids with iron rings woven in between.
<br>Her clothing like a rainbow with all colors you could imagine. "My name is Ruse. I
<br>suppose you have come to change these hideous clothes into something more, well,
<br>fitting?"
<br>Malina blushed. Hideous clothes? "No, no. I", she startled. Maybe she should get
<br>some new clothes. Her dress was ripped and tattered from the thicket she walked
<br>through and she felt horribly out of place already. Her clothes weren't doing her any
<br>favors with that. "If I were to want new clothes, what would I have to do for them?"
<br>"Well, my dear, you have to ask me nicely. I will do the rest don't you worry."
<br>"Apologies, but I don't seem to understand. I don't have to pay you anything for the
<br>clothes?". Malina was baffled. Clothes were hard and expensive to make, especially
<br>in this forest were the next fabric store was days away.
<br>"With what would you pay me anyway", she asked and laughed. "We have no money
<br>here. Everybody provides something for the tribe. I make clothes. Karman is our
<br>chief and your sleeping buddy, Aelana, is our best hunter. We all pull our weight. You
<br>will, as I heard, be a teacher for the little ones."
<br>"Yes, I will." What a weird concept. No money? "Only problem is I can't seem to find
<br>the three little ones."
<br>"They are most likely hiding from you. They would rather go on with the adults for
<br>the hunt. If you follow the sun, you should get to a small creak. The little ones often
<br>play there if they don't want to be found."
<br>"My thanks, Ruse", Malina said. "And I would wish some new clothes. But can I ask
<br>for a few alterations?"
<br>"Don't worry, I know how you lowlanders like to dress, my dear. I will see to it."
<br>Malina hesitated. She could just leave it like this. Not mention that she would like to
<br>have her neck exposed, but that would defeat the purpose. "If it isn't any trouble, I
<br>would like my neck to be exposed, but I would want something to cover my chest
<br>completely."
<br>"Ah, you are already starting to embrace your new life. It's a big step I am sure. I will
<br>get right to it. Maybe I even have some pieces for you already."
<br>"Don't you need to get my measurements first? How do you know they will fit me?"
<br>"I am doing this my whole life. Don't you worry, I have keen eyes."
<br>So Malina thanked the seamstress again and made her way to the little creak, where
<br>the children were supposedly hiding from her. How would she convince them to
<br>come with her?
<br>The sun was blinding her as Malina made her way through the forest. It was a rare
<br>treat to see and feel the sun in all of its glory. The Enlightening must be sending her a
<br>sign, that this was a good idea. He was offering her His support. The trees were far
<br>apart and she could see for quite some distance. The leaves shone in a bright green
<br>with the sun behind them, the air felt warm. After a little while Malina could hear the
<br>creak gurgle ahead of her. It was like a thin blue snake carving throught he forest. The
<br>water level was lower than when it rained, so around the water was a vegetation free
<br>zone. The children were nowhere in sight.
<br>What did she think? They would be right here, where she happened upon the water?
<br>They could be either down stream or upstream for quite some way. How was she
<br>supposed to know? Anxiety rising in her stomach. What would Karman do if she
<br>couldn't teach the kids or even worse not decypher the tablets? She didn't want to
<br>think about that.
<br>"Hello", she said, but scowlded herself for it. She needed to be louder than this for
<br>anybody to hear her. "Hello", she tried again, still barely above her previous one.
<br>"What do you want." Malina startled and jumped. Noone around her, but she heard
<br>the voice. The voice of a girl.
<br>"Where are you", Malina asked and turned around searching for the speaker.
<br>"Up here", the voice said. Malina turned and looked up. In one of the trees, a little
<br>girl, not older than six years, was sitting comfortably with her back against the trunk
<br>and her legs dangling at either side of a thick branch. Her face was smeared with
<br>mud, her clothes just the same.
<br>"Hello", Malina tried again, "I am Malina. I am new here but Karman has instructed
<br>me to teach you how to write and read words. But for that I need you to come down
<br>from that tree."
<br>"But I don't want to come down. Why don't you come up here. We can learn just as
<br>good here as down there."
<br>"That's a terrible idea. Where would we write on, where would we get something to
<br>write on in the first place." Malina began to panic. She didn't even think about on
<br>what she would write with these children. She only ever wrote on nice pieces of
<br>paper. But there was no paper here.
<br>"If we can't do it up here, I don't want to", the girl said.
<br>Malina tried to calm herself. She would find a way to get that dirty child down from
<br>the tree. "Why don't we start with our names. I am Malina. What's your name?"
<br>"Zaral", the girl mumbled. "Is it true you come from outside the forest?"
<br>"Yes, it is. I am from Nigita."
<br>"You know, I actually wanted to stay and learn from you. But Ezir and Mon said they
<br>didn't want to." She leaned closer, Malina feared she could fall from the tree. "They
<br>don't like you very much."
<br>"Why would they not like me? They don't know me yet."
<br>"They know you are a lowlander", Zaral said and began to climb down from her tree.
<br>"They are younger than me and they can't think for themselves yet. The adults were
<br>talking about you and they listened on. It's nothing personal, you know." Why had
<br>nobody  talked  to  her  directly?  Malina  thought  they  accepted  her.  The  only  one
<br>speaking up was Tara.
<br>The last part of the tree, Zaral jumped off and landed safely on her feet. "Where are
<br>the other two", Malina asked and tried not to sound hurt.
<br>"They are over there", Zaral pointed over the creak and up a tree. Behind the cover of
<br>the leaves, Malina saw two small children hanging in the tree. She tried talking to
<br>them but she didn't get a single word out from them. She was devastated. She had no
<br>idea children could be that difficult. Malina herself would have never acted this way.
<br>If she ever spoke against her father or her tutor, she had been hit several times.
<br>Malina didn't remember how her mother treated these things. She was too young
<br>when her mother died.
<br>"Is there any way I can convince them to come down, Zaral", she asked.
<br>"No", she answered. She was crouching down and playing with a little bug walking
<br>through the sand and clay ground. It was still wet from the reciding creak.
<br>"Alright, fine", Malina said and looked at the children hiding in the tree. "We will
<br>begin without you two, but you can come down whenever you want and join us." She
<br>was hoping for them to get curious enough to want to come and down from their
<br>hiding place. Otherwise she would only have one pupil after all.
<br>Malina looked for a long twig, with which she could write in the sandy ground near
<br>the creak. She would need to make the symbols big for them to be visibile from up
<br>the tree.
<br>"So, what would you like to learn how to write", Malina asked.
<br>"I don't know", Zaral answered looking up from the ground.
<br>"Why don't we start with your name. Zaral is a beautiful name. It consist of two parts.
<br>The zar symbol and the ral symbol. I will draw them into the sand here and you will
<br>try to do it like me afterwards, alright?"
<br>Zaral nodded and Malina began to draw the symbols. It was harder than she expected.
<br>With ink and paper the lines, curves and dots were easy to get down clean. But with
<br>little stones in the way here, she her lines were crooked, the curves not smooth at all.
<br>It wasn't hard for Malina to remember the symbols at all. She had memorized them
<br>perfectly. A short moment of proudness for her.
<br>"How do you know where the lines go?", Zaral asked after she finished. She was
<br>walking around them looking at them from different angles.
<br>"Someone told me where they go for each of the parts."
<br>"But there are so many words. You know how to draw every single one of them?"
<br>Malina thought for a second, "Probably most of them. I would have to look special
<br>ones up in a book, but they are not used frequently anyway."
<br>"Can I try now?", Zaral asked.
<br>"Sure. Do it right next to mine. Do it slowly." Zaral made her first line with lots of
<br>care, slowly but precisely and jumped back to Malina's first symbol to see where the
<br>next one would go. The symbols were a good step long and high.
<br>Malina looked over to the tree where the children were hiding, but they didn't move
<br>and showed no intention to do so. They had to come down sometime though. Malina
<br>was impressed by how well Zaral drew the symbols. Her strokes were almost cleaner
<br>than her ones and the child's eyes were wide, shining with a deep brown. A smile on
<br>her face, she began the second symbol, faster this time.
<br>"Very impressive", Malina said after the girl had finished. And she meant it.
<br>"What do we learn next?", she asked.
<br>"First we need to clean the ground to have a nice canvas to write on again", Malina
<br>said. The girl grabbed a piece of bark and began to fill in the lines with new sand.
<br>Malina showed Zaral all sorts of symbols, from the symbol for tree, man, woman and
<br>the sun to more advanced symbols like water or river. Some of the words were
<br>written with a single symbol. In that case it often had some resemblance to the actual
<br>word. In other cases there was no single symbol for it and so you had to write the
<br>word with their syllables next to each other. Sadly, the other two never joined Malina
<br>and Zaral, which made Malina very uncomfortable. How would she explain that to
<br>Karman?
<br>As the sun rose to its highest point in the clear blue sky, Malina and Zaral made their
<br>way back to the camp. Zaral fell behind her to catch up with the other two kids who
<br>followed Malina with quite some distance between them. She didn't want to confront
<br>them after the failed attempt in getting them to learn from her. What did she think
<br>would happen? What did Karman thought would happen here? She wasn't a teacher,
<br>she didn't know these people at all and now she was suppose to tell the children what
<br>to do. It was prone to fail at the start.
<br>Zaral came running back to Malina, "Can I ask you something?" Her eyes were clear
<br>and strong surrounded by the mud and dirt on her face.
<br>"Of course you can", Malina answered and hoped it was writing related. "Anything.
<br>What is it you want to know?"
<br>"Ezir didn't want to ask you himself, he is a bit shy. But I think we were all this way
<br>when we were younger. I sure think I was. But now I am a lot more confident. My
<br>father always says I am noisy, but my mum hits him for that, so I don't really know."
<br>"I thought you had a question", Malina interrupted by started giggling. The girl was
<br>adorable.
<br>"Yes, yes. He wants to know why your clothes go up to your head. He thinks it looks
<br>stupid. And isn't it too warm under there?"
<br>"Well, where I come from, women are expected to hide their neck from people who
<br>are not their family. It's a little bit like women who grew up here show one of their
<br>breasts. Well, it's something like that."
<br>"Is it? I don't understand why you hiding something of your body and women here
<br>showing part of their body is similar. But don't worry, Ezir doesn't know what he is
<br>talking about. He is just a little baby who can already walk. I think you look beautiful
<br>even with this thing around your neck."
<br>"I guess, thank you. I think that was a compliment."
<br>As they entered the round clearing in the middle of the camp, Aelana was already
<br>back from her hunt. She had several rabbits tied to a branch and was working on
<br>skinning one of them already. The smell of blood and fresh meat hung in the air like
<br>soft mist. How did she manage to be back so much faster than the other? And why
<br>was she always going alone?
<br>Enough with the useless questioning, Malina told herself. She needed to concentrate.
<br>Teaching the children wasn't a success, but it was probably a mere job to keep her
<br>occupied in the eyes of the other tribe members. Her real job was working out the
<br>stone tablets, for which Karman seemed to have high hopes.
<br>Malina grabbed something to eat while she worked, said goodbye to the smiling
<br>Zaral, who ran of with the other kids, and made her way to Karman's hut. The stone
<br>tablets never left his hut and she was instructed to do her work inside, sheltered from
<br>the eyes of the other tribe's members. The hut was not more luxurious or larger than
<br>Aelana and her own. The roof was just high enough to stand up right for Malina, on
<br>the ground were some animal pelts and fur for sleeping. On the far back of the hut,
<br>leaning on some thick branches, which worked as support for the leave roof and
<br>sides, the tablets sat.
<br>On grey slate symbols were engraved. The tablets themselves as long as Malina's arm
<br>and as wide as her forearm. Three tablets filled to the brim with writing. A form of
<br>writing so familiar to her but so different and alien at the same time. She saw the
<br>symbol for tree, but it wasn't the same as she learned it. The lines didn't match up,
<br>there was another dot on top and two new lines going right through. This wasn't
<br>written like Malina herself would write, but it looked so smiliar.
<br>On the third and last tablet, it wasn't a symbol that was engraved at the top, it was a
<br>picture. Something Malina had never seen but knew what it was at first sight. A
<br>Sinbu, one of the forest's giant cats.<br></p>
