            <p>Chapter 6
<br>
<br>
<br>With thorny bushes gnawing at Malina's skin, she tried to make her way through the
<br>thicket. Tears streaming down her cheeks like the rain from above. They were silent
<br>tears, not a single whimper leaving her mouth. The clouds seemingly weeping with
<br>her. She thought about making her way through these woods with Dago. Did they
<br>only head north or stray from their path east or west? She didn't remember. She didn't
<br>thought it would be important one day. But now it was.
<br>She still felt his hands on her body. These rough hands of a stranger. Even after hours
<br>of scrubbing her body with burning hot water the filth did not wash off her body. The
<br>smell. Everything. She felt vomit coming up from her stomach but forcing it down.
<br>She needed to push that memory away. As far away as possible in the deep, deep
<br>dungeons of her mind. There they would be in good company, she supposed.
<br>Where was the little tree village? She knew this wasn't a good plan, but where else
<br>would she turn too? Where do you go when your home because not safe anymore, she
<br>asked herself. She would probably die in these woods. Devoured by a sinbu, a giant
<br>cat creature as dark as th night, left behind to starve with a broken leg or just
<br>wandering around until her legs couldn't keep walking anymore. She would starve,
<br>right here in these cloudy woods. For a moment she asked herself what might be the
<br>best way to go. Starvation or devoured by a sinbu
<br>Those hands. The images bubbled up to her consciousness again, but she repelled
<br>them violently. Again she tried to force them down, this time deeper than before. She
<br>errected walls between them, as high and thick as she could imagine them to be.
<br>She kept on forcing her way further, leaving her old home behind with nothing but a
<br>small spark of hope. Something she clung to like moths to the moons. Trees became
<br>shorter, the way steeper with more rocks underneath the forest ground. She needed to
<br>take extra care not to trip over fallen branches or stumble into holes in the ground.
<br>Her legs beginning to burn and her lungs gasping for air. How much longer could she
<br>take this?
<br>And then there was this feeling again. The feeling she had when travelling with Dago.
<br>Invisible eyes following her, hiding from her sight. Malina looked around her, turned
<br>from side to side, searching for the origin of this feeling. She couldn't find it then and
<br>she didn't find it now. She scanned the branches high up in the trees, nothing.
<br>"Hello", she shouted into the empty forest. The rain a soft background noise. No
<br>answer. It was probably just her fear lashing out. What a stupid idea it was. Why
<br>would these savages treat her any different? She had nothing but the words of Dago, a
<br>drug merchant, to go on. How pathetic. It didn't make any sense. She was about to
<br>turn around, leave her fate in someone else's hands. Abandon the idea altogether. This
<br>was no place for a Scarra after all. Her family was as old as the Highlord's, once
<br>prestigious enough to mingle with the lords and ladies. Not anymore though. Who's
<br>fault was that?
<br>A body popped into existence from behind a tree, only a couple of metres in front of
<br>Malina. It was woman with bow and arrows in her left hand. Her posture up right
<br>with strong arms, much stronger than Malina's father ever looked. Her blonde hair
<br>was unusual for one of the forest people. She didn't have one of her breast exposed
<br>neither. Her clothing simple leather with the fur of a Sinba on her right shoulder.
<br>"Lost your way little bird?", the stranger asked.
<br>Malina mustered up all her confidence and strength, "I am looking for Karman. Is he
<br>of your tribe? I wish to talk with him. It is important"
<br>"About what matter would you like to speak to Karman, little bird?"
<br>"The matters are between him and me. I wish not to speak about them with someone I
<br>don't know."
<br>"I see." The stranger waited. "I think you should turn back to where you belong. This
<br>is no place for people like you."
<br>Turn back? She couldn't and she wouldn't. He either accepted her or she would die
<br>trying. This sense of finality gave her strength. When there is no way back, it is easier
<br>to keep on going. "I won't turn back. You will lead me to Karman or you have to
<br>shoot me down right here." She was surprised herself hearing the confidence in her
<br>voice. A slight tremble was there for the ride as well.
<br>The stranger smiled. "I see. You may follow me if you can. If not I won't have to
<br>waste a good arrow on your fragile body." And with that the stranger walked on,
<br>quickly Malina tried to catch up but the tempo was fast. Her legs weak and her breath
<br>short.
<br>"I am Malina", she shouted at the strangers back. "What is yours, if I may ask?"
<br>"You may not."
<br>"What should I call you then when I want to get your attention?"
<br>"Persistence. I wouldn't have guessed to find a quality like that in you. You seem like
<br>the type who gets their way on the first try at everything. I feel surprised."
<br>"You should get to know me a bit more before jumping to conclusions then."
<br>"Oh I know enough about you." Crushing through a thorny thicket, Malina found a
<br>narrow trodden path before her. From here on walking was easier, and they quickened
<br>their pace.
<br>"And what would that be?"
<br>"I know I want to save my breath and not waste it on you. So do us both a favor and
<br>shut up before you draw the attention of something you wouldn't want to meet."
<br>Malina bit her lip. The way the stranger woman talked reminded her of her father.
<br>That dismissive tone, condescending. He brought that out whenever he was angry at
<br>her for something, which happened more and more often.
<br>After walking silently Malina and her unfriendly companion made it to the camp
<br>safe. The woods cleared out in front of her and the busy small camp appeared in front
<br>of her. But a fw people the camp was deserted. Had they moved again? The blond
<br>stranger didn't stop like Malina had and went on straight towards on of the huts in the
<br>trees. The last she was here Malina didn't notice how makeshift everything was. The
<br>huts seemed to have been build in a rush, most of the unfinished, the conncetions
<br>betweent mere branches to balance on to get from one hut to the next.
<br>"Wait", Malina cried out.
<br>The stranger stopped, "What?"
<br>"I don't see Karman. Where is he?" A short moment of doubt, of anxiety. Could it be
<br>that he had died?
<br>"He is out hunting like everybody else. Life isn't as simple here. You will see that
<br>soon enough. That over there is his hut." She pointed to one of the bigger ones,
<br>almost in the centre of the whole village. Malina wasn't sure if it even was considered
<br>a village with so few people. The only settlement she knew was Nigita. A city with
<br>thousands of people and big buildings. Here she was surrounded by buildings fit to
<br>hold maybe a couple of dozen people. "You may wait there if it pleases you, but don't
<br>get too comfortable, you won't stay long I am sure."
<br>A ladder leaned on the thick tree trunk leading up to the hut. Should she wait in his
<br>home? Not without an invitition she shouldn't. Or should she? Malina didn't know the
<br>customs of how to act around these people. She only learned how to do so in Nigita,
<br>not with these people.
<br>Malina decided to wait under the trees in one of the seating areas. It was the same
<br>Dago and her had sat some time ago. How long had it been? A few people were
<br>walking around the camp with baskets full of things Malina couldn't make  out.
<br>Nobody bothered her though. She was sheltered by a few giant plant leaves so the
<br>rain wouldn't soak the logs she sat on.
<br>After waiting for hours, the sun close to hitting the horizon, Malina heard commotion
<br>all around the camp. The hunters were coming back from their day's work. Men as
<br>well as women made their way to the clearing in the middle of the camp. Some of
<br>them  carrying  game  bount  to  thick  branches.  They  carried  their  food  on  their
<br>shoulders. Again, Malina was uncomfortable looking at the specific nude spots. It
<br>was no sin to show skin for woman of class in Nigita, but to show a whole breast or
<br>even their necks was unheard of. Feeding children in public was allowed if the breast
<br>was covered from stranger's eyes, but fully exposed with rings and rods through the
<br>nipple. It made her blush.
<br>At the front of the group Karman walked proudly with head held high, the nose ring
<br>reflecting the shallow sun rays. Some of the people looked at Malina funny, but most
<br>did not care it seemed. Karman made his way towards her, putting his bow to the side
<br>and sitting down.
<br>"I see you have returned", he said. His black hair clutching to his forehead. "How did
<br>you find us here? I hope you didn't stumble upon our camp by accident."
<br>"No. I was following a woman, blond hair, Sinba fur on her arm. Sadly, she never
<br>gave me her name."
<br>"Ah, it is Aelana you speak of. What a funny conincidence it is for her to guide you to
<br>our camp."
<br>"Why is that?"
<br>"You see", he leaned forward, "she is like you in a way. She came from the lowlands
<br>wanting to make a living out here. We accepted her into our tribe, almost with no
<br>difficulty. She has been with us ever since. I was just a little boy when she came. She
<br>keeps to herself a lot but she is the best hunter I have ever seen in my life."
<br>A woman with black braids along her head and green eyes came over to the two. She
<br>wore several rings on her ears and left nipple. Her face cold and fixed on Malina.
<br>"What is the meaning of this, Karman", she asked.
<br>"This is Malina, our guest." His voice was calm but his body uneasy.
<br>"Look at her, she can barely walk by herself. Your five year old is more capable than
<br>her. You can't be seriously considering to accept her?"
<br>"Tara, that is enough", Kalman with raised voice. "You do not decide in these matters.
<br>Responsibility falls on the chieftain, have you forgotten who that is?"
<br>"No", Tara conceded and looked down. "Apologies. Do as you see fit." With one
<br>poisonous glance to Malina she left the two alone.
<br>"I have to apologize for her behaviour. Times are tough for us and we have barely
<br>enough to feed our own. But tell me, what brings you to us?"
<br>Malina hesitated. Should she tell him everything? No, he wouldn't want to hear her
<br>sob story. She needed to show him what she needed. "I want to stay with you. I have
<br>turned my back on the lowlands and I don't plan to go back."
<br>"I see", Karman said and stroked his beard. "I guess Dago put the idea in your head
<br>then, eh?"
<br>Malina's stomach turned. This didn't sound good at all. "He mentioned it, yes." Her
<br>mouth as dry as sand.
<br>"We do not discriminate in who can join our tribe as a lot of the others do, but we do
<br>have rules to follow. One is, everybody needs to pull some of the weight for the
<br>group.  We  have  children and  old people  to care  about. Aelana  came  to us and
<br>promised she could bring something back every day. And she did. The question is,
<br>what can you do for us?"
<br>The question echoed in Malina's head. What could she do? She learned how to smile
<br>at men to attract their interest but that wouldn't help her here. She knew seventeen
<br>different dances, at least two for every occasion you could think of. Four of the just
<br>for the harvest festivals. Then she knew something.
<br>"I can write", she said.
<br>"Write?", Karman looked skeptical. "You mean you can draw sounds?"
<br>"Yes, I can draw sounds. If there is a word I know the symbol for it. My father made
<br>me practice since I have been four years old." And failure was punished severely. She
<br>rubbed her hands.
<br>"It means you can also read the symbols if I were to give you some arrangement?"
<br>His blue eyes lit up. "We treasure old stone tables with for us unknown symbols
<br>engraved on them. They are said to be from when lowlanders and we were of the
<br>same  people.  United  not  divided.  I  wish  to  know  what  is  written  so  we  can
<br>understand better. But all I asked didn't know what to make of them. Well, we only
<br>had men like Dago to ask, but now this could change."
<br>"I will gladly take a look and decypher the stone tablets. If that means I can stay?"
<br>She was unsure if this was a good idea. Malina knew all the symbols, she learned
<br>them for years, but if Karman was not exaggerating, these stone tablets were old.
<br>Ancient even. What if the symbols had changed since then? She would need a way to
<br>figure it out anyway. This was her only way in.
<br>"Splendid", Karman grinned. His whole face seemed to be flooded with joy. It was
<br>important to him. "Then there is only the question of shelter for the night. Hm.
<br>Aelana is the only one living alone and we don't have time to build a new hut. So I
<br>guess we should go and ask her."
<br>"Aelana. No, no. She didn't seem to like me at all. She will never say yes to this."
<br>Malina was mistaken. Aelana accepted with a shrug, she was there only for sleeping
<br>anyway. She didn't seem to care at all.
<br>The hut was more than simple. Hanging up in the trees there wasn't much space at all.
<br>The two women had just enough place to fit too beds in. But they couldn't be called
<br>beds. Back at her father's house, she had a worm and soft feather bed with thick wool
<br>blankets and pillows. Lots and lots of pillows. Some small some bigger, all with
<br>different stitchings. Here in the forest, all she had was some animal fur to roll around
<br>her body. They slept on the wooden floor with nothing between them.
<br>On the wall, Aelana had a hung her weapons. A short bow for hunting with several
<br>arrows and two swords. Their bend blades sheathed in black leather. One was almost
<br>as short as a normal knife, Malina had never seen a blade that short, but she didn't
<br>know about warfare to begin with.
<br>Aelana caught Malina's eyes glancing over the blades, "If they go missing, I promise
<br>to make you die a slow death. Don't touch them and we are fine."
<br>Malina nodded, terrified to live with her without any walls between them.
<br>The only things she brought with her out here were a golden bracelet from her mother
<br>with a tiny ruby and a thin blanket she snatched from the servants quaters. At least
<br>she had something to keep a bit warmer at night. Her blue raincoat hung at the
<br>entrance, water dropping from the sleeves.
<br>"Come on little bird", Aelana said. "It's time for evemeal." And so the two women
<br>climbed down form the tree, which was quite the task for Malina. The height wasn't
<br>the problem, but the small ladder swayed a bit and creaked like it would break every
<br>minute. But it didn't.
<br>Over a big crackling fire, flames fighting against the soft rain from above, the tribe's
<br>people cooked their evemeal. There were berries of all colors, most Malina had never
<br>seen in her life. Meat from a big deer and a stew made from roots and all sorts of
<br>other foraged goods blubbered in a big cauldron. The atmosphere was light and some
<br>were singing. Back with her father's evemeals were very different. They were silent,
<br>awkward and devoid of life. Servants bringing fancy meals, which weren't special at
<br>all. It was all about appearances. The cook was instructed to make the simple food
<br>look special.
<br>"Malina", Karman shouted over the singing, "come sit with us." He pointed towards
<br>an empty place next to him. A little boy sitting on his lap, who looked like his son.
<br>Two other women were sitting to his left and a giant men on the other side. He had a
<br>braided beard and little iron rings at the end of them. His head shaven to the naked
<br>skin. Malina still wearing her own clothes, hiding her neck from view. Looking very
<br>out of place.
<br>She sat down between the shaven giant and Karman, food on wooden plates in their
<br>laps. The stew smelled delicious.
<br>"You have aquainted yourself with Aelana a bit more, I hope", Karman said.
<br>"I wouldn't say that", Malina said. "She seems to me like someone who doesn't like
<br>company much."
<br>The giant on her right laughed, "Did she threaten you yet?", he asked. His voice twice
<br>as loud as any others. He was almost shouting.
<br>"In fact she already did. I am not to touch her belongings."
<br>"Don't worry too much about it. That woman scares the rainin' woods out of me." It
<br>made Malina laugh. This giant of a man, arms twice as big as her thighs almost was
<br>afraid of that woman? Aelana was strongly build but she didn't compare to this man.
<br>"But where are my manners, we have a real lowlander lady among us. Let me
<br>introduce myself, my name is Choco." He took Malina's hand and gave her a soft kiss
<br>on her fingers. She blushed, trying to smile but she felt uncomfortable shifting in her
<br>seat. "Here take some." He gave her some of the meat with his knife. Malina took it
<br>and put it in her mouth. She was starving and the food was delicious. She got her own
<br>plate, filled with berries and nuts.
<br>The other people started talking again, almost forgetting Malina was there at all. It
<br>was fine for her. Fading into the background was good. She didn't need any special
<br>attention.
<br>Out of the corner of her eye she saw Choco raise his arm and Malina flinched and
<br>gave off a high pitched shout. She held up her arms in defence in front of her face.
<br>The other four people falling silent within a heartbeat.
<br>Malina's heart beating fast she forced herself out of the defensive posture. She felt
<br>ashamed, it was only a reflex. Choco looking at her with disbelief.
<br>"Did you think I would hit you?", he asked, eyes wide with, what was it, horror?
<br>"My apologies", she said. "It was only a reflex. I wasn't thinking at all."
<br>"I don't know how your life has been", Karman chipped in, "but around here, noone
<br>raises their hands towards someone. We do not accept violence without justification."
<br>"My apologies if I have scared you", Choco said honestly.
<br>"It is me who has to apologise", Malina said. "I wasn't thinking ill of you. Apologies."
<br>The rest of the evemeal went quieter with less gesturing around and Malina felt at
<br>fault for it. As the night grew darker she excused herself from the others and went
<br>towards Aelana's hut. Half way there, shrouded in darkness, too far from the fires to
<br>see much, a shadow materialized in front of her.
<br>"You might have Karman wrapped around your little weak fingers", the shadow said
<br>with familiar voice. "Lowlanders always bring trouble. I will be watching you." It
<br>was Tara the woman who spoke up to Karman. Without anything else she vanished
<br>silently.<br></p>
