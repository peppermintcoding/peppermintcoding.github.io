<br>
<br>
<br>"You will keep what you saw to yourself, do I make myself clear," Aelana's voice was
<br>silent but frightening. "I will not have my secret be spread around like some folktale.
<br>I have been hiding it successfully this whole time, and this little misstep will not
<br>change anything about it."
<br>"But why," Malina said. "You could do so much with your talent. You could, I don't
<br>know, end all war?"
<br>"Yes, I thought so too, but then I grew up and understood how this world works. If I
<br>kill a tyrant or a war mongler all I will get as his replacement will be someone just as
<br>cruel and selfish as the first one. And if I am extra unlucky they new Highlord will be
<br>even worse than the one before that. No, I have lost my interest in the diplomacy
<br>between the Highlords." Aelana was putting her weapons on the rack at the wall, her
<br>dagger still around her waist.
<br>An idea had blossomed in Malina's mind when she saw who Aelana really was. An
<br>idea that could change everything. "Could you teach me then?" she asked and Aelana
<br>froze in her movements hanging her bow on the wall.
<br>"It is not something I could teach, especially not you."
<br>"Why especially not me? You think I couldn't train with you?"
<br>"It's not about that. To walk the shadows you must be trained from birth not a second
<br>later. You could never aquire the powers I have even if I would train you for fifty
<br>years. There is no special secret that will make you into an Onkari. And all the
<br>masters are dead anyway."
<br>"Wait? They are dead?"
<br>"I do not like to dwelve in the past. Let's focus on what is ahead of us, ahead of you.
<br>Do you know what will happen when the hunting parties get back here?"
<br>"They will be horrified of course. An attack on their camp must be terrifiying and I
<br>think from what I heard, we will move from here to somewhere else."
<br>"Somewhere else? There is no somewhere else. This is as close at it gets to the border
<br>of the forest to even have a chance of avoiding the lowlanders and getting enough
<br>animals to hunt. There is no moving. But that is not what I am speaking about?"
<br>"What then?" Malina asked, already afraid of what she might say.
<br>"The camp got attacked today, while for almost two years we have been living here.
<br>What do you think changed in this time the most?"
<br>"They wouldn't think.. They wouldn't."
<br>Aelana was shooting her a strange look. "I have nothing to do with this," Malina said
<br>and sounded anxious. Could they hold her responsible. But how would she even do
<br>something like this? Would they think she was a spy for the Lival all along and only
<br>pretended to be a lowlander? She looked not like a forest woman for sure, but was
<br>that enough to not direct suspicion onto her?
<br>"Be ready for it," Aelana said. "Be ready to fight, in your case with your words
<br>because I don't think you would have any chance in a real fight."
<br>"What about you? Will you let them do whatever they want with me? You know I
<br>couldn't have done this."
<br>"Do I know that? I don't as little as all the others about you. Get up they are coming."
<br>Malina looked helplessly at Aelana leaving the hut and she turned back and said,
<br>"Don't worry, if you keep my secret I will get you out of this alive. I promise."
<br>Out of this? The only place she could go from here was back home to her father. Was
<br>that even better than dying? Malina scowled herself for the thought. Her father had
<br>made mistakes, yes. But maybe it was time to come home anyway. He must be dying
<br>of sorrow. Being left behind alone without any more family. The thought made
<br>Malina sad and tears dwelled up in her eyes. Maybe it was time to get home.
<br>She climbed down the ladder from their hut and saw the hunting parties stream back
<br>into the camp. Their faces grim and angry. The scouts must have told them the story
<br>about the attack already. Malina spotted Tara. Her eyes cutting through the air, Malina
<br>saw fire in them. Like a sinbu ready to pounce and devour its prey. This would not be
<br>easy.
<br>The  camp  was  in  total  turmoil  when  Malina  stepped  down  from  the  ladder.
<br>Everybody had come together and was standing around the little circular clearing in
<br>the middle of the camp. Their faces filled with fear, anger and helplessness. Malina
<br>was looking for Karman, to have at least somebody who might be on her side, but she
<br>couldn't find him. He wasn't there. It felt odd. Where was he?
<br>Choco came from the crowd and pushed some people away to get to Malina. He
<br>looked  confused  and  frightened.  This  giant  of  a  man,  frightened.  It  didn't  help
<br>Malina's fear.
<br>"Are you alright?" he asked. He extended a hand to grab her by the shoulders but
<br>froze midair when Malina slightly turned away, her body reacting before her mind
<br>could even think a single thought.
<br>"I am sorry," she said. "But I am alright. Everything is fine. I wasn't harmed. How
<br>about the others?"
<br>"It seems the children were all safe. They hid in the tree. Zaral was completely out of
<br>it. She is frightened like the rest of us, I feel. I am glad you are alright though. The
<br>gooddess be blessed." He kissed his extended fore and middle finger and raised them
<br>to the sky. The rain falling heavily down on them. Their clothes were soaked already.
<br>"I must tell you, Malina," and he moved in closer to her, his voice a whisper. "I don't
<br>know what will happen to you. It might have been best if you left the camp already."
<br>"So you think I am at fault as well?"
<br>"It's not what I said. I don't believe you could even do something like this if you
<br>wanted. You had no relations with the Lival or any other forest tribes, that was clear
<br>at first sight. But not everybody will be thinking the same. People are frightened and
<br>angry, we lost four of our people, slaughtered before Aelana could stop them. That
<br>woman is a mystery to me."
<br>"What should I do? Wouldn't leaving raise more suspicion than if I stay?"
<br>"Surely  it  would,  I  am  certain.  But  it's  a  good  thing.  You  would  be  gone  and
<br>everybody could live with the thought that you were the traitor. It makes things easier
<br>for everybody. But now that you stayed, I don't know what will happen."
<br>Choco turned around as Karman and the two women, who were sharing meals with
<br>Karman, Choco and Malina, walked into the middle of the clearing. Karman looked
<br>quickly at Malina, she couldn't tell what he was thinking. His face was a mixture of
<br>too many feelings at once. Tara, who had been walking up and down, stopped and fell
<br>silent. Everybody fell silent one after the other. Malina spotted Zaral and the other
<br>two kids hiding behind some of the grown ups.
<br>"We have come together here," Karman began with a loud and clear voice, "to mourn
<br>the dead and decide what to do with our future. The Lival have discovered our camp
<br>and we can't be sure that they haven't sent someone back to talk of our location. We
<br>will need to decide what to do now. I open up the discussion for everybody to take
<br>their part. We will decide like we always do, together." The people, still silent in their
<br>tracks, looked around for whom to go first. Malina looked at Tara and the woman
<br>entered the circle. Karman and Tara standing face to face, encircled by the tribe's
<br>people. Malina held her breath.
<br>"Before we think about a new plan," Tara said, "I think it is important to talk about
<br>the attack together. I have a simple question: how did the Lival find us here? Does
<br>anybody have any idea?"
<br>Karman breathed heavy. "They have their ways. The bloodhunters must have found
<br>us by accident. I don't see any other reason for how they could find us so close to the
<br>border."
<br>"Oh but I can see a reason. I know you have been blinded, but a lot of us has not."
<br>Tara  turned  around  and  a  big  chunk  of  people  were  nodding  and  shouting  in
<br>agreement. "There is no liability we have let into our tribe. A woman at that. Would
<br>you please step forward, Malina." She spat Malina's name like it was disease. With
<br>shaking legs she made one step into the circle, the people around her stepping back a
<br>bit. She felt alone.
<br>"Don't you think it is weird," Tara shouted into the tribe, "that just after a few weeks,
<br>the  Lival  attacked  us,  at the  exact  moment  we  changed  our number of guards.
<br>Because of the scarcity of animals we had to leave fewer guards behind." Again,
<br>nodding and agreement.
<br>"But I didn't even know that," Malina tried to say. Her voice shaky and tears coming
<br>to her eyes. She wasn't learned in these types of confrontations. They reminded her
<br>too much of her father's anger.
<br>"Of couse you didn't know that. Who would believe that. Even a blind person could
<br>have noticed."
<br>"That is quite enough, Tara," Karman said. He was controlled, his voice barely above
<br>his normal magnitude. "It is not Malina's fault we were attacked. She comes from the
<br>lowlands not as a spy of the Lival."
<br>"Of course would you take her side. I think you can't think straight in this situation,
<br>my friend. You have been lusting over her ever since she set foot in this camp with
<br>that rainin' bastard Dago." She spat out on the ground. "I have told you all, I have
<br>cautioned you all, to not get with the lowlanders. None of them. The wares are not
<br>enough for the trouble. And we have reaped what we had sewn."
<br>"I did not lust over her and you are simply throwing around accusations because you
<br>are angry. I understand that you are, but this is no place for wrongful accusations.
<br>Malina has been nothing but kind to us and has been teaching our children."
<br>"Oh right," a man stepped forward into the circle. Malina had never noticed him
<br>before. A long scar over his cheek, black hair, small but muscular. "What has she
<br>been teaching them? Nothing but drawing in the sand. What does that help our
<br>situation? Does it bring any food for us? Any safety? It was your delurious dream to
<br>teach them, but what for?"
<br>"You know the answer to that," Tara said. "His rainin' stone tablets. Karman, let me
<br>ask you, when will you finally give up on them. They are worthless. Unreadable, we
<br>have asked before and always got the same answer, or did this little girl come to a
<br>conclusion."
<br>All eyes were on Malina. "What I found out about the stone tablets?"
<br>"Don't play dumb with me," Tara said. Her face a grimace of anger and disgust.
<br>Something Malain knew all to well.
<br>"Well," she began with shaking voice, "I have studied the stone tablets and as far as I
<br>can see they are all about the sinbu."
<br>"Oh about the sinbu," Tara said acting surprised, "What do they tell you?"
<br>"I don't exactly know. But it might be a guide for taming the beasts. If I have more
<br>time I-"
<br>"Thank you." Tara looked around the circle. More and more were looking angry at
<br>Malina, or was that only her anxiety changing the reality in front of her. "I think we
<br>heard enough. Taming a wild sinbu? Nothing more than myths from the old days.
<br>Dreamstories for children, nothing more."
<br>"It doesn't matter what you believe if they hold truth or not," said Karman. "Malina
<br>has no fault in this attack. We are here to discuss the attack not the value of our stone
<br>tablets. If you don't believe, then don't. I will hold onto my own beliefs if it is alright
<br>with you."
<br>"But that's exactly the problem, is it not? You are living in your dream world Karman.
<br>We need a leader who has the good of our people in his mind. Not stories of dreams
<br>and want. We need someone strong. Someone who can make the hard decisions and
<br>punish those who bring misfortune to our tribe."
<br>"Careful with your words," it was Choco's voice from Malina's back. "Do you know
<br>what you are saying?"
<br>Malina looked around. Something was different. Their anger had made way for
<br>something else in their faces. Something Malina didn't know what it was. Karman
<br>looked silently at Tara. The woman walking up and down like a wild cat.
<br>"I know what I am saying. Not what you thought, Choco, I do not want to challenge
<br>for chieftain, I want to have certainty. If those stone tablets are true and there is a way
<br>to tame the wild beasts, than why don't we try it. Or why don't you try it?" She was
<br>facing Malina now. Her heart stopped. She had barely decyphered the a couple of
<br>symbols and was rather sure it was about taming the sinbu, but actually doing it
<br>would require more knowledge, something she didn't know she even could aquire
<br>with years of study. A hunch told her, Tara wasn't willing to give her this amount of
<br>time.
<br>"We haven't gotten to the whole truth of the tablets yet," Karman said. "This is
<br>ludicrous. I will not stand for this. I will not let her throw her life away so you can get
<br>your anger out on somebody."
<br>"But it's not your decision to make. We all have a say in this. I propose a deal: if
<br>Malina will be able to tame a sinbu and bring them back into the camp, I will be the
<br>first one to forgive her, for being wrong about her. But if she is a traitor, like it is
<br>obvious, she will find her given punishment."
<br>This couldn't be true. How was Malina suppose to get behind the truths of the stone
<br>tablets? Malina looked around the circle of people. A couple of dozen strangers,
<br>really nothing more, deciding her fate.
<br>"Alright, we put it towards a vote," Karman said. "If you believe Malina should be
<br>tested like Tara suggested, which is I might add, ludicrous, raise your fist to the sky
<br>and let your voice be heard. The majority will decide."
<br>All at once a good chunk of people raised their hands to the sky, so fast it looked like
<br>they waited for this moment the whole time. Malina was taken aback. It was almost
<br>half of them. Malina looked back at Choco, having his arms firm beside his sides and
<br>looking grave at his tribe's men and women. Karman looked around as well, seeing
<br>what his people would decide. Another couple of people raising their arms. Slowly
<br>the tides turned and Malina thought it was the end.
<br>"Stop it," a voice shouted from behind the ranks. The voice of a child, and Malina's
<br>heart began to race. "Let Malina alone, she has done nothing bad. I can prove it."
<br>Everybody stopped in their tracks, the little girl came through the closed cirlce of
<br>people. She looked so small, so fragile. But even then she had more guts and courage
<br>than Malina could ever muster up. Slowly some of the people lowered their hands,
<br>confused of why this child interrupted their gathering.
<br>"It is noble of you to come forward," Tara said without the hate and anger in her
<br>voice. It felt more soft while she spoke to Zaral. And then it struck Malina, there was
<br>something familiar in Tara's face, she found so often in Zaral. Could it be? "But this
<br>is a decision you cannot take part in. You are a child, you don't have the mind for
<br>judgement in this situation."
<br>Zaral ignoring her and speaking with a loud and clear voice, "When the Lival raided
<br>our camp, Mon, Ezir and me, fled with Malina. They were on our tracks and we
<br>climbed up a tree to hide, the tree Aelana would come to get us when it was over.
<br>Malina couldn't get up the tree, because she slippe while climbing, but instead of
<br>showing the Lival where we were, she ran away. Practically giving up her life to keep
<br>us saafe and unseen. She got the attention of the Lival and lured them away. Without
<br>her, we could be dead. How can you doubt a person like that?"
<br>"I think you had a hard day, Zaral," Tara said, a little less soft. "But you are a child
<br>and this is a gathering for men and women, not children. For all we know, you could
<br>be  lying  because  you  don't  want  your  new  friend  to  suffer  punishment.  Your
<br>judgement is clearly clowded."
<br>Zaral gave Tara a vile glance, so much anger in this little girl. All Malina wanted to
<br>do was to go to her and hug her, tell her it's going to be fine. This was all a
<br>misunderstanding. But the people around her started nodding towards what Tara had
<br>said to them.
<br>"I think her statement is valid," Karman said, "and shall be taken into account. This
<br>decision should be made with all the facts we have. I want to stress again," he paused
<br>for a second, "that Malina comes from the low lands and she had nothing to do with
<br>the tribe of the Lival, living near the center of the forest. How could she made contact
<br>in anyway?"
<br>"You say she comes from the lowlands," Tara spat again, "but take a look at her. Have
<br>you ever seen a woman of the lowlands give up their rainin' neck protection? She
<br>seemed awfully quick to take off that piece of clothing, something deemed to stay
<br>there by law of their god. I don't see a real lowlander, I see a pretender."
<br>Again, nodding and shouts of encouragement. Malina took what little courage she
<br>had and spoke, "I only changed my way of clothing to fit better with you people. I
<br>want to be a part of this tribe, so I left my old customs behind me. All I wanted was to
<br>fit in, not to be seen as the outsider I am."
<br>"You will never fit in here," Tara said.
<br>"That's enough," Karman said. "Let's put it to a vote again. Everybody in favor of
<br>Tara's proposal, raise your arms to the sky and let your voices be heard."
<br>The vote didn't go in Malina'a favor and she felt bad for the little Zaral, who had
<br>spoken up for her but had to watch her words to be unnoticed. Karman showed her to
<br>follow him to his hut and she did, small tears running down her face mixing with the
<br>rain streaming down from above.
<br>Karman didn't talk when Malina entered the hut. He sat on the floor with his head in
<br>his hands. Malina sat down opposite of him. The water from the rain still dripping
<br>down to the ground.
<br>"Apologies Malina," Karman finally said. "I couldn't protect you. I don't know how I
<br>could be so optimistic at first."
<br>"What do you mean?" she asked.
<br>"When I first saw you with Dago coming to our camp, I thought you were the most
<br>beautiful woman I had ever seen. I thought if you were here for a couple of months,
<br>sharing food with us, learning our ways, that you and me, that we could, someday.
<br>But it didn't work out that way I fear."
<br>Malina was taken aback by this forward and honest sharing of his feelings for her.
<br>She never heard anyone talk about her this way. The only one confessing his love to
<br>her was a servant boy when she was fifteen, but the boy quickly left their service after
<br>Malina's father took notice of his behaviour and dismissed him from their house.
<br>"Apologies, but I haven't come here to be someone's wife," Malina said a little too
<br>directly. "I mean, I feel flattered by your compliments, but I didn't plan on taking a
<br>husband any time soon. Apologies, again."
<br>"I understand," he said and stroked his chin. "Then there is only one more question to
<br>answer, when will you leave to go back to your father?"
<br>Malina was ready for the question, she had played it back in her mind a thousand
<br>times. Going back, was a good idea. Was a bad idea? She didn't know because
<br>everytime  she  asked  herself,  the  result  was  different.  She  wasn't  sure  at  all.  "I
<br>honestly don't know. I don't want to leave."
<br>"But you can't stay. You haven't gotten to the secret yet."
<br>"That's what I fear as well. Maybe there is something there, maybe something that
<br>brings me back into grace with the others."
<br>"Even if you decypher the whole secret, I will not let you go and test them yourself. I
<br>myself will go and see if you were right or wrong?"
<br>"How can you trust me so much with this." Karman fell silent and thought. Malina's
<br>legs were hurting and she adjusted herself.
<br>"It's not that," he said slowly. "I have been losing the status of chieftain slowly but
<br>surely over the last year. My people don't believe I can get them out of this mess. We
<br>are rivals to the Lival because of me. Because I made a mistake and the only way I
<br>see to get our old lives back is to get behind these stone tablets. If we could tame the
<br>sinbus, we could march back to the center and reclaim our status. But without them,
<br>we have nothing. We will fade slowly, die of hunger maybe. A slow and painful death
<br>I tell you, and they will not stand for it. If they need someone to put the blame on,
<br>they found you, but after that I will be the next to fall." He paused again. "I need your
<br>help, Malina."
<br>"How long can you give me?" she asked.
<br>"Maybe a week, probably not much longer. You seriously want to stay and try, rather
<br>than go back to your father's?"
<br>"I don't know what I want, but right now it feels right for me to decide to help you as
<br>best as I can. I cannot leave you after all you have done for me. Taking me in, giving
<br>me a home even if it was temporary and at times felt nothing like one. I am willing to
<br>help and get behind the secret. And when the time comes, we will test our theory
<br>together. Either we emerge together or die trying."<br></p>
