            <p>Chapter 2
<br>
<br>
<br>Four  strange  men  were  waiting  for  her.  Malina  was  about  to  venture  into  the
<br>infamous Cloud Forest for the first time, accompanied by these scruffy looking men.
<br>Why did her father want her to go? She had no expirience in fighting, no knowledge
<br>of plants, herbs or mushrooms. She had a slender figure, short brown curls reaching
<br>just to her shoulders and a small nose.
<br>"You'll be careful out there", Richart, her father, said. "Keep to Dago, you know him
<br>right?"
<br>She knew him alright, he had visited their family home quite often in the last few
<br>years. His visits were short and he always left something behind. Dreamshrooms.
<br>"I know, but father", she began but was quickly interrupted.
<br>"No but's, Malina. You know we are short on money. It is time you pull some of the
<br>weight of this family, too. You are eighteen now, old enough to work for sure. Dago
<br>promised it is safe. The savages haven't been spotted in these parts of the woods for
<br>years. Keep close to him and all will be fine. Watch out for the red mushrooms. Get
<br>as many as you can, okay?"
<br>She wasn't convinces at all, but did she have any options? One does not talk back to
<br>their father, not in their circles. The family of Scarra fell from graze and wealth a
<br>century  ago  but  that  didn't  stop  every  generation  trying  their  best  to  hold  up
<br>appearances.
<br>"Go now, the others are waiting. I love you with all my heart, my pearl."
<br>"I love you too, father. I will do my best."
<br>She walked over to the impatiently waiting men. Dago was wearing a hat against the
<br>rain, black with colorful feathers all around. Green as grass, blue as the ocean and red
<br>like blood. She had never seen anything like it. The other three men weren't so
<br>fashionable. Their cheap raincoats had patches and holes in them, one was missing
<br>part  of  his  sleeve.  The  men  were  looking  her  up  and  down,  making  her  feel
<br>uncomfortable.
<br>"Aye, let's go", said Dago. He was older than her father with grey strains in his
<br>otherwise black hair. His nose looked like it had been broken before and a misshaped
<br>beard gave him a sort of dirty look.
<br>The three other men got packs on their backs. For firewood and food, she presumed.
<br>"You will look after her, alright?", Richart shouted after them but he didn't get an
<br>answer. Malina looked back once more and waved. For a second he saw something
<br>on her father's face but was unable to make sense of it. She was never good at reading
<br>facial expressions. They remained a mystery to her.
<br>Her father had come all the way to the edge of the Cloud Forest, but no further. He
<br>had to take care of some other business while she was gone. He would have come
<br>with Dago if he only had the time. Or so he told Malina. But lately, he wasn't as
<br>trustworthy as he once was.
<br>The thick forest building up in front of here. So close to the edge, the trees were high
<br>and had wide spanning canopies. Crossing the border between woods and grassland,
<br>she notices the rain stopped. The constant noise of drops hitting her hood were gone,
<br>only occasionally she heard a single one drop down. What a weird feeling it was,
<br>outside while it rained without feeling the constant contact with her body.
<br>The men kept shooting glances back at her, one of them walking behind Malina sent
<br>shivers down her spine. How could her father let her go with these men? What kind
<br>of company was that for a classy young woman of the upper class?
<br>"You alright, Missy?", Dago asked. He had been falling behind slowly to get to her.
<br>"I am quite fine", she responded. "Though I wonder how much longer do we need to
<br>go uphill. My legs are beginning to ache already."
<br>"Well, the shrooms we want don't grow near the border, but further in. So we will be
<br>walking for about half the day. Before-"
<br>"Half the day?", she was perplexed. "Always walking up this steep inclince? You got
<br>to be joking with me. And do I might add, it is not funny."
<br>"Meant no joke at all, Missy." The way he pronouced 'Missy' was making her upset.
<br>"They call it Cloud Forest for a good reason." He laughed. Indeed they did. The forest
<br>was spanning over the land high up to the tops of mountains. The ground would come
<br>so high, they would be on the same level as the clouds on some days. Giving the
<br>forest and even more mysterious and dangerous face.
<br>Hours later her legs were burning, her lungs working as hard as they could to breathe.
<br>The altiutde made it harder and harder to breathe though. They had two breaks for
<br>resting, but they weren't enough for Malina. Everytime she thought she would be
<br>unable to stand up from the fallen tree they were resting on. Evertime Dago pulled
<br>her to her feet and told her to keep walking. The other kept looking at her in a funny
<br>way. She didn't know what it meant.
<br>The  ground  was  soft  but  littered  with  branches,  ferns,  moss  and  ferns.  They
<br>constantly tuck on her clothes, some poking into her flesh. Everytime she cried out
<br>feeling the pain in her legs. Dago ordered her to keep walking. What choice did she
<br>have? Go back alone? She would get lost immidiatly. She didn't want to be alone in
<br>these woods especially not if the dark set in. She constantly saw movement in the
<br>corners of her eyes. Something was watching them, she was sure of it.
<br>"Okay", Dago said. "We are getting close. Keep your eyes on the ground for anything
<br>red. Pick it up with you knives. I want clean cuts, bring the shrooms to me and I will
<br>look if they are the right ones and if they are any good. Don't go to far, if you out of
<br>shouting distance you could get lost. That applies especially to you, Missy."
<br>The men fanned out in all directions leaving Malina and Dago alone.
<br>"Here, your knife." He gave her a real knife, with a sharp blade and a wodden handle.
<br>A cloth bag as well to put in the shrooms she presumed. She reached for the knife and
<br>sack. It felt heavy in her hand. She had never been allowed to hold a knife before. It
<br>wasn't fit for a woman of the right status to use sharp blades. Meals were cut by their
<br>parents when they were young, and thir husbands when they got older. Of course, she
<br>snucked in the kitchen sometimes at night and held one anyway just to feel. Still, she
<br>grew afraid of the thing in her hand.
<br>Dago must have interpreted her face correctly, "You either cut shrooms like the
<br>others, or I leave in these woods tied to a tree, you hear me?"
<br>She nodded, terrified by the pure thought of it. Why was she here anyway? Why did
<br>her father not hire some more men to go on this quest? Why sent her of all the
<br>people? She was his precious pearl, the last family he had and the last chance of
<br>revitalizing their house. Her marriage must be planned carefully to rise up to the old
<br>glorious days again.
<br>She was alone. Dago had left her standing, she saw his silhouette vanishing between
<br>the  trees.  She  hurried  along.  Something  red.  It  should  have  been  easy  to  spot
<br>something red in these woods. They weren't far enough into the forest to lose vision
<br>because of clouds and the surrounding plants were all in browns and greens. She tried
<br>to keep an eye on where Dago was walking. Always keeping him on her right side
<br>she was sure, to not lose sight of him. These woods scared her. She heard terrible
<br>stories of giant cats you would pounce on you from far away. Wolves roaming
<br>between the trees in giants packs. And then there were the savages. Folk who fled
<br>from the nine kingdoms into the forest long ago to make their life their, away from
<br>the Scorched kings and queens of that time.
<br>She saw one. It was hiding underneath some fern but the color shone through enough
<br>for her to notice. It had white dots all over the top. Did Dago mention the white dots?
<br>No he only said with a red top. But what would be the harm? She could bring it with
<br>her anyway and he would throw it away or not.
<br>Grabbing the head with her hand she cut the stem as far down as she could and put
<br>the little mushroom in her bag. She didn't know what they were for exactly. Her
<br>father would sometimes lock himself in the basement of their house and wouldn't
<br>come out for a day or so. Malina had seen him take these shrooms inside though.
<br>A branch broke with a loud sound behind her. She turned around frantically almost
<br>losing her footing. Nothing there. Nothing but trees and more trees. Their trunks not
<br>wider but their canopy closer towards the ground. She hadn't noticed the change
<br>before now. Trees looked all the same to her.
<br>She looked for Dago but couldn't see him. She felt panic rising in her stomach. Her
<br>hands began to tremble just a bit. She shouted for him. No answer. Then again. No
<br>answer.
<br>She began to walk towards were she thought the others might be. The trees impairing
<br>her field of view immensly. Big drops of water falling around. She heard another
<br>branch snap. She turned around still shouting for Dago. Where were he? How could
<br>she have been seperated so easily? Her hands clenching the knife close to her body,
<br>the bad dangling from her left hand. She heard sounds in every direction. Something
<br>was coming. She could feel it. The ground seemed to vibrate. Something big, she
<br>thought.
<br>"You rainin' girl!"
<br>She knew that voice. Dago was standing to the left of her. Looking at her with furious
<br>eyes.
<br>"You do not shout like a little brat in these woods. They are safe because we are silent
<br>and quick. If you want to attract whatnot then keep on crying like a little brat. But do
<br>it far way from me because I don't want any more company."
<br>"I.. I am sorry", she said feeling tense but more relaxed now. The ground was still, the
<br>woods quiet safe the raindrops and the occasional birds singing.
<br>"How many you got?"
<br>"What?", she asked.
<br>"How many shrooms you got in your little bag. It looks like you got nothing in
<br>there."
<br>"Oh the bad. I got one in there." Now that she said it, it sounded like nothing.
<br>Dago shook his head. "Keep on looking", he grunted and walked away. Malina close
<br>on his heels.
<br>After an eternity of looking for more shrooms they were finally done for the day
<br>when Dago signalled them to find a place to spend the night. The other three men
<br>came back with full bags of shrooms, Dago sorting through them, throwing some
<br>away but mostly he was happy with the outcome. Malinas bag held four mushrooms.
<br>Two of them Dago immediatly threw over his shoulder, the other he put with the
<br>others. She felt shame bubbling underneath her skin. The men eyeing her weirdly
<br>from the side. They were whispering to each other. She grew more and more tense.
<br>A small crackling fire gave warmth and some light as the sun went down. They didn't
<br>bring enough dry wood to make a real fire but this was better than nothing. Malina
<br>warmed her feet and hands and let her clothes dry. Her covered neck felt sweaty and
<br>sore from walking and picking through the shrooms. A large tarp prepared with wax
<br>to make it water resistant span over them. Dago placed himself between her and the
<br>other men which made Malina relax a little bit. She felt he was better company than
<br>the others.
<br>"So, boss, the night is young. We are all tired but a little fun should lighten our minds
<br>and bodies", one of the man said. A scar over his forhead, black hair and even darker
<br>beard covering most of his face. His eyes glued on Malina.
<br>"A little fun, eh?", Dago asked. His eyes wandering to Malina. For a moment she saw
<br>his face change, his eyes glinting with fire in them. Malina pulled her legs to her
<br>chest. "I think we should all go to bed early, get our strength back for the way home.
<br>And you three should try not to forget what I said. Dago doesn't talk with empty
<br>words." His eyes still hovering over Malina while he spoke.
<br>The  other  men  hesitated  for  a  while  but  then  stood  up  and  went  over  to  their
<br>makeshift tent. Malina breathed out heavily. She didn't realize she had held her breath
<br>the whole time.
<br>"Dago, if I may", she said, "what were you talking about?"
<br>"You look like a clever girl, eh?" He pulled out a knife and began to peel an apple.
<br>"By the way, do you like your apples peeled or not? I am just curious here."
<br>"Peeled of course." What savage would eat the hard and bitter skin if they could get
<br>the  sweet  and  delicious  inner  part  on  their  own.  "But  that  doesn't  answer  my
<br>question."
<br>Dago hesitated, peeling his apple. "Your father's a good man, right? I mean he's good
<br>to you, eh?"
<br>Was her father a good man? "He is the most honest man I know. He is educated well,
<br>knows  the  proper  way  around  social  events  and  has  always  provided  for  me
<br>eventhough our family has been struggling severly." She shouldn't have said that. Her
<br>family image was all that was left of their legacy. How could she give up a detail like
<br>that. Dago didn't seem to be surprised by that at all.
<br>"Here's another question for you-"
<br>"No, why do you keep dodging mine. If I have to answer one first, that's alright. But
<br>now I deserve some information, too. This is not the proper way to treat a woman of
<br>class." Eventhough her body was still tense and frightened, her voice was stern and
<br>clear. A sound in the woods made her jump.
<br>"Ah, the proper ways, eh? You think I don't know how to treat a woman rigth? Should
<br>learn something from your father then."
<br>"To be frank, you absolutely should. It is not right to leave me picking throught he
<br>dirt in the Cloud Forest and doing so basically alone. I was frightened to death before
<br>when I lost sight of you."
<br>"Why do you think your father has sent you with us on this trip. I mean, a woman of
<br>class working as a shroom picker, in the Cloud Forest with no guards or honorable
<br>men around. Does that fit your description of your father right?"
<br>The question had been fermenting in her mind all this time. Why did he insisted on
<br>sending her on this trip? She knew he had business to attend in the city, so he couldn't
<br>part take in this endeavour himself. But why not send someone else? A worker
<br>perhaps? Well, they had no money to spend on these things anymore, but a woman
<br>with no experience at all? It made no sense.
<br>"Ah, I seed the little pretty head of yours cooking. At what conclusion did you arrive,
<br>Missy?"
<br>"I", she hesitated, "don't know. Why don't you tell me already?" A feeling in her
<br>stomach told her not to ask. Not to dwelve deeper into this conversation, to just stop
<br>and go to sleep, walk back to Nigita and leave this all behind. Another part of her
<br>wanted the answer.
<br>Dago gave her a piece of his apple, she accepted with a thank you. The apple was
<br>good, juicy and sweet. "Four lonely man, in the woods with nothing to do at night."
<br>He looked down at his apple, pulling one piece after another into his mouth. "And
<br>then there is a lonely woman with them, who doesn't know how to forage, doesn't
<br>know how to fight, doesn't even know how to look after herself." Malina felt a pinch
<br>in her heart. Then it dropped down to her knees, her face became pale like the white
<br>moon Ocreis behind the clouds. Her hands shivering, not of the cold.
<br>"No", she gasped.
<br>Dago met her eyes. "What a rainin' world we liv' in, eh?"
<br>No.<br></p>
