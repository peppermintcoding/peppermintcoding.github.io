            <p>Chapter 13
<br>
<br>
<br>The war machinery of Highlord Rember was beautiful and frightening to Asher.
<br>Everything worked perfectly together, all the parts fit together like the quartz blocks
<br>of Asta, without enough space for a piece of paper between them. It was like getting
<br>to the last part of building a closet, without the help of nails, the pieces were built to
<br>weeve together, locking tightly without the help of anything else. It felt like that.
<br>Leaving  Asta  with  the  Highlord  himself  was  like  a  grand  parade.  People  were
<br>standing around the main street, throwing flowers and singing songs for the soldiers.
<br>When finally outside the city, with every cross road more and more soldiers, lords
<br>and waggons joined the Highlords army. It was smooth and without delay.
<br>The Highlord has commanded all of his available troops to get to the eastern border
<br>to Nigita, where the war would take place. This was more than the usual border
<br>skirmishes, where a couple of hundred soldiers of the lower ranked lords would fight
<br>over one bit of land. This was bigger, grander than anything Asher had seen before.
<br>He had heard stories of war and how heroes were made and buried therelike, but this
<br>was different. It wasn't a bedtime story to frighten or entertain children. This was real
<br>life and he was right in there with them.
<br>Asher and An were moving with the army, while Lilith was left behind to keep up her
<br>training, whatever that meant. He still didn't know and was afraid to ask. Her powers
<br>exceeded his own by an indefinite amount. The army must have been thousands of
<br>men strong, maybe even scratching the numbers of ten thousand. A huge army, with
<br>an even larger trail of provision, workers, shelter, siege equipment and women. Asher
<br>kept his distance to the soldiers, their eyes looked either scared or frightened at them.
<br>But with the word of the Highlord nobody would harm them.
<br>"Are you nervous," An asked, walking next to him through the rain. The ground was
<br>so muddy it was hard to walk. Thick pieces of mud clinging to the boots.
<br>"Aren't you? I don't know if I am ready for a war," Asher said. His red hair was
<br>hidden underneath a deep hanging hood, but the red belt around his waist was enough
<br>to identify him as a Scorched.
<br>The road to the border was long. They travelled for one week already and were
<br>supposed to not arrive till the late evening in their war camp. A tross of waggons was
<br>pulled by strong bulls, slowly making it along the muddy road.
<br>"Did you say goodbye to Lilith before you left?" An asked.
<br>"Well, she wasn't at breakfast that morning and I haven't seen her after we met in
<br>your room, so sadly no."
<br>"Why not? Don't you think that's kind of rude?"
<br>"She told me to not treat her differently like the others. She wanted space between us
<br>so I thought I give her that."
<br>"That might be true, but don't you think it would be the proper way to give her a
<br>personal goodbye. I mean after all, we were kind of friends and you don't plan to
<br>come back with us."
<br>"Be quiet about that," Asher hissed. He looked around anxious somebody could have
<br>overheard their conversation. The plan was risky and he wanted to keep it as secretive
<br>as possible to be achievable. "Let's not talk about our plan, alright?"
<br>"If you say so, sure." They walked in silence for a bit. The only noises coming from
<br>the bulls in front and behind them and the rain on their hoods, like little drums.
<br>"So you think I should have given her a proper goodbye?" Asher asked, but the words
<br>felt wrong in his mouth. Why didn't Lilith joined them for breakfast that last day? She
<br>knew they would be leaving an hours later. Where was she? For Asher it was clear:
<br>she didn't want to see them off. The reasons might be shrouded in mist, but he was
<br>certain that was what Lilith intended with her actions.
<br>"I think she would have liked for you to say goodbye to her," An said. "She is a little
<br>weird sometimes, but she actually likes you. So it was a bad move on your part."
<br>"Hmm. I didn't get that vibe from her."
<br>"Of course not. It's hard for us to feel close to others, because we can't act on feeling
<br>that might arise. But it doesn't mean we shouldn't look for any closeness with other
<br>people. Even Lilith wants company sometimes."
<br>Asher was thinking about An's words and how Lilith has acted towards him. He
<br>wasn't sure what it all meant, but now that he was out on the road with the army,
<br>moving towards the war, from which he hoped not to return to Asata, he regretted not
<br>saying goodbye.
<br>A group of soldiers passed them on their right and they cursed at Asher. One spat out
<br>and they went on their way. The words they used were never pleasant, but it mostly
<br>didn't bother Asher much. An on the other hand was growing increasingly angrier and
<br>with it more bold. He threw some words back to the group of soldiers, but they didn't
<br>turn around. Even with the words of the Highlord himself, the soldiers and other folk
<br>didn't trust, neither liked them. Asher couldn't blame them. They must have heard
<br>stories or expierenced them themselves. Story like the one with Ameline.
<br>The more time Asher spend on this trip with people from all over Nagano, the more
<br>he was puzzled by the amount of personal stories the people shared about Scorched.
<br>Apparently all over the country more and more people awoke to their curse and most
<br>of them,  sadly,  were  killed  within  hours  of  their  change.  It  felt  weird,  to  have
<br>survived, what most others didn't seem to be able to do.
<br>When they finally arrived at their final camp, so close to the border, the land of Nigita
<br>could be seen with their own eyes, Asher and An were showed towards the medic's
<br>tents. Huge tents with hundreds of beds packed next to each other were being set up.
<br>This, unfortunaly, was not the place to work for Asher and An. Their talents would be
<br>valuable on the battlefield, where it would be impossible for a medic to light a fire
<br>due to the heavy rain and Asher and An would try and heat up instruments for the
<br>medics to use. It should lessen the effect of infections for the wounded soldiers. At
<br>least that was the theory, nobody had ever tested it before this war.
<br>While in the camp it was harder to keep space between Asher himself and the others
<br>soldiers, most of them were not accustomed to the way Asher and An had lived back
<br>in Asta. They knew to hold their distance but with the narrow streets between rows of
<br>tents  and  others  makeshift  buildings,  it  was  hard.  Even  harder  when  inside  the
<br>medic's tents. Asher and An were wearing more clothing them normal and it was hot
<br>underneath them. Lord Amberic was under the impression the layers of clothing
<br>could lessen the impact of their curse, but up to this point, cloth had not been
<br>successful in holding back. Not even metal would hold for long. The flames would
<br>find their way through the thick metal and burn whatever was behind it. Somehow,
<br>the flames felt there was flesh in their reach and they were calling for it, finding their
<br>way through everything.
<br>"There you are," a slender man with the blue colors of the medics corps said. His hair
<br>was short, almost bald. "You two will be paired up with the two best of our field
<br>medics.  Anderius,  who  is  that?"  An  raised  his  hand  and  smiled  half  heartidly.
<br>"Alright, you will teamed up with Coran and your friend, Asher, will be paired up
<br>with San. You will meet them tomorrow morning, the have been delayed and have not
<br>yet arrived at the war camp. Quite unusual if I might say, but that doesn't concern
<br>you." He looked around nervously, scanning the room. "Oh," he said, "you are still
<br>here? You are dismissed. I have important matters to attend to, so please not get in my
<br>way and burn me alive, if you can." He walked away, letting An and Asher behind,
<br>standing lonely in the turmoil.
<br>They made their way back towards the center of the warcamp, where Highlord
<br>Rember had his own majestic tent. It span a wide radius, perfectly round with a high
<br>ceiling. It could easily harbour a hundred people or more at the same time. The colors
<br>where of red and gold, the Highlords personal color scheme. It was real gold plated
<br>and woven into the fabric to make intricate patterns. Some were plants, some were
<br>symmetrical  in  nature  and  some  where  representations  of  people,  mostly  the
<br>Highlords family and deceased wifes.
<br>Asher and An were given a tent close to the Highlord so they would be close and
<br>protected, eventhough Asher didn't feel like he was valued here at all. Not by the men
<br>at least. All he got was sorry eyes or angry ones, mostly both actually. Even An wasn't
<br>his natural cheerful self, the smile on his face barely visiting and his eyes deep in
<br>thought most of the time.
<br>"What do you want to do?" Asher asked when they entered the tent together. Two
<br>makeshift beds of straw and some pelts. A fireplace in the middle with an exhaust
<br>right above it. The top of the tent was cut of and then raised by wodden supports so
<br>the smoke could travel outside but the rain wouldn't fall down on the fire.
<br>"I don't know," he said and sat down on his bed. His hands supporting his head from
<br>falling down. His red hair matching the red belt. "Normally I would suggest to drink,
<br>what else can you do on the eve of battle really. But I don't like drinking alone."
<br>"Apologies," Asher said and meant it. He felt sorry. Lately he had been debating the
<br>topic of alcohol more and more. On same days he came to the conclusion he didn't
<br>want his father to have this kind of power over him. Just because he was worse off
<br>with drinking, he himself shouldn't suffer anymore under this than he already did. But
<br>then again, the simple thought of smelling the sharp smell of liquor was enough to
<br>turn his stomach and bring memories up.
<br>"No, don't. It really isn't your fault. I mean, what would it change anyway, rigth? I
<br>think we should rather talk about your plan." Asher took a piece of wood from the
<br>fireplace and held it in his hands. He lit it on fire within a heartbeat and put it together
<br>with the others to let the fire burn. Lately he had been practicing it every morning and
<br>evening, and it showed. He was quick about guiding the flames from within him to
<br>the outside. "So, did you think about how you want to stage your death and run off
<br>towards your home?"
<br>"If you put it like this, it sounds stupid."
<br>"Well, it kind of is. I know I am the one who suggested it, but the way back to Yevum
<br>will be long and hard. You have no money, no map, no idea how to hunt, you can't
<br>interact with normal people, because they would see your hair and disgard you in a
<br>second. So how do you intend to solve any of these problems?"
<br>"Thank you for making me worry even more," Asher answered and hung his rain coat
<br>next to the fire to dry. He dropped of his boots and lay down on the bed, looking
<br>towards the ceiling. "I don't know anything. The only thing I really know is, I need to
<br>get back to Yevum. I need so see if my brother is alright, I fear for his well being."
<br>"I see. So let's break it down, money first. What should we do?"
<br>"We could steal some?"
<br>"Great plan, Asher. Let's steal from the soldiers here, who despise us already. Do you
<br>think the Highlord would leave us unpunished during war? You know the punishment
<br>for any offense is death, for stealing it is at least giving up your hands. And I don't
<br>know if we will be any good without our hands."
<br>"Alright,  why  not  shoot  down  every  idea  I  have?  Do  you  have  anything  to
<br>contribute?"
<br>Asher looked at An from the side and An told him what they would do. The plan
<br>maifesting in Asher's mind into something tangible. Would this work?
<br>Sleep came slowly to Asher and was short lived.
<br>A horn woke Asher from his dreams. He had seen terrible things with his brother and
<br>needed a moment to collect himself, An was already up and getting ready. If the horns
<br>were sounded, everything needed to move fast. The enemy wasn't waiting on the
<br>battlefield for long, until they would try and all out attack on the camp. A disordered
<br>army was easy picking for the enemy.
<br>Asher put on his boots and coat and he wanted to go out the tent when An told him to
<br>wait a second.
<br>"Good luck out there and don't try anything on the first day. The battle will drag on
<br>for weeks at miminmum, so keep out of trouble for now, before we figure everything
<br>else out, alright?"
<br>"Sure," Asher said. "Good look to you to, I will be looking forward to seeing you
<br>after the battle. Don't play the hero, alright?"
<br>"Never wanted to, never will." The two left the tent. Rain splashing down from the
<br>sky, big drops drumming against Asher's hood.
<br>Outside,  soldiers  were  streaming  from  the  tents  and  making  their  way  to  the
<br>battlefield, towards the rising sun. It wouldn't be good for the soldiers to fight against
<br>the sunlight, but heavy clouds were shrouding the Enlightening's eye enough to not
<br>blind any men. An and Asher made their way to the medic's tent where they would
<br>meet up with their partners. Soldiers hurrying along side them, jogging in full armor
<br>and with their weapons.
<br>The armor of the soldiers was made out of hard leather. Big tiles were overlapping
<br>each other and protecting most of the body, only down under the knee the armor
<br>made room for some simple cloth under garment. Most of the armor was painted red,
<br>like the Highlord's tent with cold insigia on them. They wore traditional helmets
<br>made of leather as well, covering their hats and keeping the rain from their eyes. The
<br>helmets were a circular shape abover their heads, slanted to the left side. Their face
<br>half covered by wodden masks, leavin only the eyes free to see during battle. Armed
<br>with spears, or some wealthier soldiers, with real sords, they looked fierced and well
<br>trained. Asher was again, strangely impressed by the accuracy and familiarity the
<br>soldiers acted around the camp.
<br>The two split up to meet up with their respective partners for the remaining time of
<br>the war. San was waiting in front of the medic's tent, An had to go look for his. Asher
<br>wished him good luck again and An walked inside the tent.
<br>"I have three rules," San said. His clothes in dark blue, like Asher's own. Only the red
<br>belt and his hair distingiushed him from the others. "Number one, you do not touch
<br>anything or anyone without me telling you to. Number two, you do not talk back to
<br>me about the best cource of action when taking care of a wounded soldier. I heard
<br>you had some training, but this is the real world and I won't see my soldiers die
<br>because you want to show of some of your shady knowledge." The man talked like
<br>the soldiers were his own children it seemed to Asher. "Number three, don't get
<br>killed. Am I understood?"
<br>"I think number three is kind of irrelevant, don't you think? It's not like I want to get
<br>killed on the battlefield."
<br>"Alright, number two will be extended. Do not talk back to me ever. I am here to do
<br>my job and if this ridiculous plan of Highlord Rember will work, we need to do our
<br>best."
<br>They started walking towards the formation of soldiers. Thousands of them lining up
<br>outisde the camp, the noise was immense. "What would you normally do without my
<br>help?" Asher asked curiously.
<br>"Your help, hilarious." San didn't laugh. "Normally we would get the soldiers from
<br>the battlefield as quickly as possible, but a lot of them would die of bloodloss before
<br>we could get them back. Our job will be to get to serious injured soldiers and stitch
<br>them up as quickly as possible. So I will wash their wounds quickly with some fresh
<br>water and then you will give me a heated blade to close the wound. Is that possible
<br>for you?"
<br>Asher began to like this guy. Eventhough he seemed to not like Asher at all, the man
<br>seemed to care about his work a lot and Asher respected that. "I can do that." He
<br>wasn't sure how long it would take to heat up the blades everytime, but he would try
<br>his hardest to keep the soldiers alive. After all, they had human lives in their hands. A
<br>responsibility he never had to endure. He felt nervous.
<br>San and Asher were watching the battle unfold from behind the lines of the soldiers.
<br>The army was divided into smaller divisons, every division held a dozen soldiers,
<br>who would fight together as a unit and hold each others backs free. Whenever any of
<br>the smaller divisions raised a blue flag, the team of medics were to dash over to them
<br>and aid them  as best  as possible. Asher  and San  would take  care  of the badly
<br>wounded, the rest would be brought back to the medic's tent in the warcamp for their
<br>medical attention. Smaller cuts, brusies, broken bones and therelike would be treated
<br>with less urgency. The deep cuts and high blood loss was what Asher had to deal
<br>with.
<br>"Keep calm," San said, noticing how nervous Asher was. "You're not gonna die today,
<br>I promise. And something else, if you need to vomit, do it away from anybody. Don't
<br>want any of your vomit on my soldiers, right?"
<br>"Understood,"  he  answered,  tipping  from  one  foot  to  the  other.  The  lines  were
<br>forming up against each other. Highlord Rember standing with his personal guard and
<br>his bannermen in the center of his army. From there he was going to give orders,
<br>however that would work, Asher wasn't quite sure. All of the banners looked so alike,
<br>but slightly different. To tell the difference in the battle must need years of training
<br>and trust from everybody.
<br>It started slow, but the armies rolled against each other with an inevitability Asher
<br>found frightening. Finally metal clashed with metal, spears were thrusted, but Asher
<br>could  barely  see  what  was  going  on.  The  rain  made  the  armies  recede  in  the
<br>background.
<br>"Left flank," San cried out and was already dashing towards it with high speed. His
<br>clothes rattling through the wind, a bad of tools in his hand. Asher tried to keep up
<br>but was falling behind. The muddy ground made him almost slip and fall.
<br>A man was getting carried back through the ranks from the front line. His face
<br>smeared with mud, his dark hair clinging to his head, the helmet gone completely. He
<br>had deep cuts on his legs, the armor didn't hold back the blow completely. San was
<br>already doing his work. Removing the part of the armor with a knife, cutting the
<br>leather straps, which held the armor together. The piece fell down.
<br>"Asher, sterilize the knife, now." And Asher did as told. He got out the knife from his
<br>little bad and held it between his hands. San trying to stop the blood flow in the
<br>soldier's leg. He wasn't concious anymore. The velvet blood flowing like little rivers
<br>from the wound, the rain washing it away within seconds. The wound was filled with
<br>pieces of grass and mud.
<br>Asher commanded the flames within in to heat the blade in his hand. It was harder to
<br>see that anything happened, a faint glow, which was not visibile in this weather was
<br>all somebody could have seen. The metal slowly warming and getting some color.
<br>Asher normally took more than half a minute to heat the blade enough to use it for
<br>closing a wound with burning.
<br>"Are you done yet?" San cried out again, looking at him. He held his hand out for the
<br>blade, and after a few more seconds he gave San the blade. It glowed faintly red, it
<br>must have been hot enough. Asher was sure of it, when he heard the sizzling of the
<br>falling rain of the blade and when he saw San burn out the wound, to stop it from
<br>bleeding. He worked fast and within seconds, he handed the blade back to Asher.
<br>Asher felt himself recede into the background. This was suppose to be his time to
<br>shine. He was suppose to help theses soldiers, he had learned so much. Was it all for
<br>nothing?
<br>"Keep it hot at all time," San shouted to him over the battlfield noise. Horns were
<br>sounding now, which probably meant some formation changes, because the men in
<br>front of Asher shuffled away. "I don't want to wait for it next time, we could lose the
<br>next one. He is barely going to make it if we are lucky." The man was ash white in his
<br>face, some other blue medics carrying him back to the warcamp.
<br>Asher looked around him, still catching his breath from running before. Blue flags
<br>raised from every side of the battlefield. They were too many. The battle most have
<br>been going badly for the Highlord. San was already on the move, shouting back to
<br>Asher to follow him. Asher tried to keep up, but again the nible medic was gaining
<br>distance arriving at the next wounded soldier far before Asher would. He tried to gain
<br>speed, but it was his downfall. He slipped on the muddy ground, losing grip of the
<br>heated blade in his hands. It flew across and Asher lost track of where it landed. He
<br>cursed but kept on walking.
<br>Finally, when he met up with San he cried out for the knife already. "Are you rainin'
<br>serious? You dropped it? Then get a new one quickly. Here." San gave Asher a new
<br>blade from his bag, but the blade was cold. He commanded the flames again, but it
<br>was too slow. He saw the men in front of him die in San's arms. He was frantically
<br>trying to stop the bloodflow to the soldier's right arm. A deep cut watering the ground
<br>with crimson liquid.
<br>Asher saw it happen before him. The man slowly dying, with him trying to heat up
<br>this blade in his hands. Was this really all he could do? Was this what he was
<br>prepared for? Why learn all these medical skills, when he would never use them. It
<br>made no sense. But he knew one thing he could do. One thing he was trying to forget,
<br>so he didn't think of it. He remembered that day in Balin's barn with Ameline. He
<br>heard her scream again. This time would be different though. This time he knew what
<br>he was doing, and he knew what it was for.
<br>Asher crouched down next to San and told him to step aside. San only shouted at him
<br>to finally give him the blade, he was losing him. But Asher didn't listen. He held out
<br>his hand and touched the wound with his bare hand. Just a quick touch not more, but
<br>the flesh immidiately burned away, giving off that scent he had smelled before. It
<br>made him sick, but he didn't back away. He again touched the wound with the side of
<br>his hand, following the course of the wound. His hands were shaky and he burned
<br>more than he needed too, but the wound closed. San staring at him. The other medics
<br>getting the body from them and carrying the soldier away from the battlefield.
<br>San shot Asher a look. He didn't look happy about the situation, but there was no
<br>time. They had to go. They were needed somewhere else. Blue flags against the
<br>heavy rain clouds guiding them towards the wounded. Asher finally found something
<br>he could do with his curse.<br></p>
