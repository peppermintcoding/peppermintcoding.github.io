            <p>Chapter 7
<br>
<br>
<br>Cleric Saratsu's lessons were always long and exhausting. They learned a new way to
<br>clean and stitch up deep cuts. It was a hassle without touching the pig patien, but
<br>Asher felt getting more and more confident. An tried to talk about yesterday's evening
<br>but  Asher  didn't  bite  the  bait.  He  was  still  angry  at  basically  all  of  them,  but
<br>especially Lilith. Eventhough she found her sitting beside his bedroom door, already
<br>sleeping like baby. He sneaked into his room without disturbing her alcohol induces
<br>sleep.
<br>Because Asher was the only one not drinking yesterday he had an unfair advantage at
<br>listening to the cleric's directions. If the cleric noticed anything different with his
<br>students, he didn't say.
<br>"Asher could you stay with me a few more minutes?", Saratsu asked while the Patric,
<br>Kathhrine and An lef the classroom. Eventhough the windows were wide open, the
<br>smell of blood lingered heavily.
<br>"You expressed a wish to write to your family. A messenger dog will leave tomorrow
<br>morning to make a round. It will pass through Yevum so now is the best time to write
<br>to your family. What would you want to write?" He took out a clean piece of paper,
<br>dipped the feather in ink and waited.
<br>What wanted he to write? He knew what he wanted to know, but wasn't sure how to
<br>write it. After all Ogerius would be the one reading it to his father and hopefully his
<br>brother. He simply wanted to know if they were doing fine. His brother must be going
<br>through the worst time of his life. Alone with their father, an ill mother to care for and
<br>noone to talk about it.
<br>"It doesn't have to be much. Write I want to know how they are doing, especially my
<br>mother and brother. And tell them I am doing fine here, I already found some friends
<br>and I will be coming home soon."
<br>"You will be coming home soon?", Saratsu raised an eyebrow.
<br>"Just write it down. I will find a way to come back home."
<br>"I suppose you can dream and hope, but to be honest with you, you won't be going
<br>back to Yevum."
<br>"You don't know that", Asher said and tried to contain his anger.
<br>"Oh, but I do know. Nobody ever gets back to their home town. Because you will not
<br>survive there long. What do you think will your townspeople do with you? They
<br>know what you are, they know what you have done already. They fear you. What
<br>does an angry town mob do when they are afraid of someone with a special gift? It's
<br>no surprise that in this institute there are no more than fourteen people. Nine small
<br>children and you five older ones. But the fire comes to so many more these days."
<br>Would they actually kill him? Asher knew these people since he was a baby. He
<br>worked with them, ate and drank. On the day of awakening Ogerius hid him from the
<br>people in the monastary. They were marching on Asher's home, with weapons.
<br>"Write it anyway, if you may cleric. It will be good for my brother."
<br>"As you wish." Asher went out the door of the classroom.
<br>On the opposite wall Lilith was leaning. Her hair a mess like always, her long neck
<br>covered by the cold grey cloth they all had to wear. Her eyes not meeting his own. He
<br>wanted to walk past her, leaving leaning there without a word.
<br>"Please wait", she said and held out an arm to block his way, still careful not to get
<br>too close. "I wanted to talk with you last night."
<br>"Really?", he said. "Didn't look like it last night."
<br>"You could have woken me and we could have talked, but you were the one sneaking
<br>around me. Didn't you see I wanted to talk to you? I even waited outside your room."
<br>"Now it is my fault for not wanting to talk? What should I have done? Tapped on
<br>your rainin' shoulder? It's not like we can do that. In any case, did you consider I
<br>didn't want to talk to you last night?"
<br>"Alright, just listen. I came here to tell you, you were right. It is not a competition
<br>who has more dirt in their past and it doens't mean that you were not hurting just as
<br>much as we others. It is simply different I suppose. We never tasted the life like you
<br>had and that breeds envy, I guess. Nobody of us can imagine how it must feel to get
<br>that taken away from you, we only know the other side of the coin. So I guess I got a
<br>bit angry because, you know, I got a bit angry."
<br>"Is that it? Can I go now?"
<br>"Come on, don't be like that. I apologized. I also wanted to offer you my help with
<br>learning how to deal with your talent. An might be a good teacher to you, because
<br>you don't know any better, but they all learned from me. I know it best, so let me
<br>teach you. The start is always hard, but I promise I can get to over it."
<br>Asher wasn't feeling An to be a great teacher, but he wasn't bad either. He simply
<br>didn't find the rigth words, Asher thought. Maybe it could benefit him to learn from
<br>Lilith. After all she actually knew the most about this. Maybe he could get some more
<br>information  about  this  talen  of  his.  But  spending  more  time  with  Lilith  wasn't
<br>something he looked forward too.
<br>"Alright, you show me how I can use my talent and I will accept your apology."
<br>"Good, you want to do it now? I got some time before I will have to go on with my
<br>training."
<br>"Sure."
<br>"Let's go to my room, we won't be disturbed there." So they walked aside each other
<br>with plenty of distance between them. But for the first time, Asher felt the distance to
<br>be much closer than it had been.
<br>"By the way", Asher asked, "what is it you do in your training? It doesn't seem to
<br>have anything to do with medical procedures. What kind of use did Lord Amberic
<br>find for you?"
<br>Lilith hesitated. "It's hard to explain. We can talk about it another time, alright?"
<br>"Sure." Lilith opened the door to her room. It was simple, like Asher's own room. A
<br>bed with feather matraze, a little fire place and a closet for clothing. No fancy
<br>bookshelf like in An's room. It felt empty.
<br>"So there we are", she exclaimed and waved her arms around the room. She noticed
<br>Asher's look. "Expected something more? Not actually fit for a princess is it?"
<br>"Princess? I never-"
<br>"Don't worry. I know it's how An and others call me sometimes. Truth be told, I am
<br>the furthest from a princess you can think of." They sat down in front of the fireplace,
<br>a few pieces of wood stacked on top of each other, ash covering the ground.
<br>"So how's your mother, if I am allowed to ask?"
<br>"My mother?", Asher was taken aback. This came out of nothing.
<br>Lilith eyes avoided his again. "I kind of dropped eves on you while talking with
<br>Saratsu. Apologies."
<br>"I see." Asher wasn't sure if he felt angry about it or relieved. After all now they were
<br>beginning to talk like normal people, eventhough the questions were highly personal.
<br>"My mother, she got ill when my little brother was born. She isn't doing very well."
<br>"Oh no, the mother's curse?"
<br>"Sadly, yes. She had been doing better after suffering for two full years. She was even
<br>standing again, walking around. I had the highest hopes she had beaten the illness.
<br>But in the end it took her again, shackling to her bed. It's been hard."
<br>"I feel for you", she said meeting his gaze.
<br>"Do you, or do you simply say because it's what people always say?"
<br>"I mean it how I said it. Truth is I don't know your pain, I never had a mother."
<br>"Did she die when you were born?"
<br>A long pause. Asher shifted his legs a bit. Sitting crosslegged on the hard floor made
<br>his legs ache.
<br>"I don't know what happened to her." Lilith looking down, fumbling with her hands.
<br>"My parents didn't want me. They put me in a basket, a piece of cloth in my mouth so
<br>I couldn't cry and left me in a canal. When the rain came I was to suffocate under the
<br>water. And I almost did, if not a group of clerics fished me out of the water. They
<br>took me in, into an orphanage. They cared for me the best they could eventhough I
<br>was a danger to everybody."
<br>"So that's when you awoke then?"
<br>"Yes. I never knew any other life than the life of a Scorched. Never felt a human
<br>touch. Or any others for that matter. I remember so vividly, we had a flock of sheeps
<br>at  the  orphanage.  They  had  thick  wool  on  their  bodies  and  the  children  loved
<br>touching them. They looked so soft and warm. I was longing to touch them, but I
<br>wasn't allowed. The risk to high for me to injure one of them. They gave me some
<br>wool from the sheep on its own as consolation. But it wasn't the same. I wanted to
<br>touch a real sheep." Asher's hand automatically went over to Lilith, but he stopped
<br>mid air and pulled them back. It hurt him physically in his stomach not being able to
<br>touch her right there, right then.
<br>"I feel for you", he finally said. Lilith's eyes meeting his. No tears in her's.
<br>"But let's not dwelve into the past too much. We are here and that is what counts.
<br>After all, you are here to learn and not to relieve the past. So, are you ready?"
<br>"Yes I am. Let's try it. See who is the better teacher after all."
<br>"Well, this is not a competition at all. An doesn't know what he is doing at all. You'll
<br>see. Take a piece of wood out of the fireplace."
<br>Asher did so, "I couldn't even bring dry tinder to ignite, how am I suppose to get this
<br>piece of wood to burn?"
<br>"It's not about the material, you can create flames on everything you set your mind to.
<br>You simply need to know how. Now close your eyes, hold the wood in your hands
<br>and feel it's texture. The sharp edges. It's weight. Now look inside of yourself and
<br>find the flame."
<br>"So far, you are not doing anything different to An."
<br>"Hold your words and keep looking. The first time is always the hardest. Once you
<br>know where it is hiding inside your body, you will be able to call upon every time
<br>you want. So hush and hear inside your body. Think about how you move your arms,
<br>how you command your legs to put one foot in front of the other. How you can roll
<br>your eyes at my directions. It's hiding somewhere."
<br>Asher tried to locate something he had no idea how it would feel. Again, he went
<br>through his whole body, asking where the flame might hide. It was ridiculous. Maybe
<br>he didn't have one after all, awoke to late and now has to live with only the curse side
<br>of it without any benefits.
<br>"Let's  try  something  else."  Her  voice  was  soothing,  it  sounded  like  the  rain.
<br>"Sometimes you find the flame where your feelings are. Anger is one of the best ways
<br>to find it. Think of something or someone who made you rainin' mad and then see if
<br>you can find the flame where that feeling of anger originates."
<br>Anger. He had lots of anger inside. About last night, about Lilith and actually all the
<br>others too. But that wasn't real anger he understood. He was angry at them in the
<br>moment, it was fleeting anger. What he felt for his father went deeper inside his
<br>bones. He could feel the heat of anger. It was in his chest, pressing down and making
<br>it harder to breathe deep. He thought of his drinking, how he was when he came
<br>home drunk and let his anger out on his children. Angry for something they weren't at
<br>faul. And there he found a different kind of heat. Underneath all this anger something
<br>small but burning hot was hiding. He could feel its fiery tounges licking, could feel
<br>the heat. He tried to maneuver the heat towards his hands, to the piece of wood
<br>waiting there.
<br>"Open your eyes, you got it", Lilith said. Asher openen his eyes and saw flames
<br>gnawing at the wood. They were faint, a yellow and red swirl. But they were here. He
<br>did it. He looked at Lilith, who was smiling at him. Smiling, for the first time he saw
<br>her smile.
<br>"You should smile more often. It looks good on you", Asher said but it did the
<br>opposite of what he would have anticipated. Lilith'S smile froze and vanished.
<br>"You should go now."
<br>"Did I say something wrong?", he asked. The flames had vanished completely. They
<br>left the piece of wood almost unchanged, a thin layer of dark charcoal formed on one
<br>side.
<br>"Just leave me. I am tired and need some rest. We can talk more tomorrow  at
<br>breakfast."
<br>Asher left Lilith's room with three pieces of wood he grabbed from her. One for more
<br>practicing and two for carving. But why was she so nice the one moment and so
<br>pissed the next? He didn't know what he did wrong.
<br>Weeks went by and Asher was desparetly waiting for an answer to his letter home.
<br>His dreams revolved all around his mother and brother, how they were doing. Mostly
<br>nightmares they were. Saratsu's lessons in medicince further enhanced Asher's skills.
<br>He was able to clean and stitch all kinds of cuts in record time. Sterializing his tools
<br>with his own flame was getting easier and easier with every try. He had practiced
<br>every evening in his room. It became almost like using a limb like his arm.
<br>And then there was Lilith. He tried to make it up to her with carving something for
<br>her. He wasn't sure what he needed to apologize for but he wanted to anyway. So he
<br>carved a sheep out of the wood he took from her room. It was small, only as big as a
<br>fist, but Asher got all sorts of details in there. He knew sheep from Balin's farm and
<br>he knew how they felt when touched. Not as soft and perfect as Lilith thought herself
<br>but more oily and rough. The miniature wooden sheep had a snout, ears and even
<br>eyes. The body was carved into as close to sheep wool as Asher could get it.
<br>When he went over to her room to give her the sheep, it didn't went like he expected
<br>it to happen. He was knocking on her door, waiting with the sheep in his hand.
<br>"What do you want so late, Asher?", she asked. She was obviously getting ready to
<br>sleep. Her eyes worn down from the day. The cold grey robe was gone, only her
<br>underwear showing, with a long sleeve shirt which covered her neck and a slip.
<br>"I wanted to give you this", Asher handed her the wooded sheep. He tried not to
<br>wander with his eyes down her body, but focussed on her eyes. For a second he saw
<br>them light up with joy, he could tell. But shortly after, she frowned and look at him
<br>funnily.
<br>"That's a sweet gesture of you, but you shouldn't have", she said. "Take it back
<br>please."
<br>"No, I made it for you. I won't take it back." He made a step backwards.
<br>"You need to stop treating me differently than the others. I haven't seen you make An
<br>or Kathrine a present like this."
<br>"Because they didn't help me find my flame like you have. An tried, for sure, but
<br>that's about it. You helped me, so I got you something. You were kind of angry at the
<br>end, and I don't know why."
<br>"And you think a present of a sheep would help me get less angry?"
<br>"I don't see why it would make you more angry at me, but delight me with an
<br>explanation." They voices grew louder and louder. The other's must be able to hear
<br>this.
<br>"I don't want you to look at me like that everytime we are alone together. I don't want
<br>presents from you, that make me smile and forget for a second what I am. What we
<br>are. Because we will never be able to change it. Don't you understand? I don't want to
<br>end up like Patric and Kathrine. Madly in love, but unable to touch one another. It's
<br>the most cruel torture I have ever witnessed." She broke off. Slammed the door in
<br>Asher's face.
<br>After that Asher tried to keep more distance between himself and Lilith. Though he it
<br>was harder than before. He didn't want to stay away from her. It was right there, he
<br>truly  understood.  They  couldn'  fall  for  each  other.  The  smallest  spark  must  be
<br>extinguished at first sight.
<br>Asher tried to stay away from Lilith as much as possible. It was easy sometimes,
<br>because they had lessons in different parts of the building, but sometimes it cost him
<br>quite a lot of constraint. He still didn't know what she was learning while he was
<br>training to be field medic.
<br>Listening to a monologue of cleric Saratsu about the dangers of battle made it easy
<br>for Asher's thoughts to wander. Saratsu went on and on about one detail he tried to
<br>cement in the students brains. The number one cause of death on a battlefield was not
<br>by a sword, spear or club, it was infections and diseases that came from lying in the
<br>mud and dirt of the battlefield. Infections spread fast and killed fast. After class he
<br>wanted to speak with Asher alone, he even closed the door this time for more privacy.
<br>"So Asher, I have been given a letter from your cleric in Yevum." He took out a single
<br>piece of paper from a drawer. He put it on the table, marked with symbols in black
<br>ink. Only the rich could afford to give their children education in writing and reading.
<br>Or if you decide to be a cleric.
<br>"What does it say?", Asher asked. He was at the edge of his seat. Finally some
<br>answers to his questions. Finally some certainty parting the clouds in his mind.
<br>Without proper knowledge his mind made up the most horrible fantasies. His mother
<br>was dead, his brother with her. Ameline's father was out to kill him. Now he maybe
<br>got some proof.
<br>"My apologies to tell you this, but it says your mother is doing worse again." These
<br>words. He had been imagining them hundreds of times in his mind, but he still wasn't
<br>prepared for the feelings rising in his body and mind. His chest was to tight, his
<br>stomach was rebelling and his mind blank like the white quartz walls. No thought
<br>spinning through his busy mind. Nothing. She was dead? No, no he just said she was
<br>feeling worse. But that was nothing new. In any case he had hoped for some better
<br>news.
<br>"Aplogies", he tried. V oice breaking, tears dropping slowly. "Ehm, are you sure that
<br>what is says?"
<br>"I feel for you, son", Saratsu answered, "but it leaves no room for interpretation.
<br>Ogerius describes her condition as very serious, but she is still alive and fighting."
<br>She was always fighting, her whole life she had to.
<br>"Anything else, he wrote. Some words about my brother?"
<br>"Your brother tells you he is doing fine. Caring for your mother is hard on him but he
<br>makes it work. And he writes your father is doing good as well, he is helping with
<br>your mother a lot." What? He was helping? Something felt very wrong here.
<br>"Are you sure cleric?", he asked again.
<br>"I am. No room for interpretation."
<br>"Yes, you said that already. Did my brother write anything about his work? How he is
<br>been doing in his service?" This was their secret phrase they would be using when
<br>communicating  something  their  father  shouldn't  know.  Work  is  good,  means
<br>everything really is good and the other way around. The last time Asher had seen
<br>Elyas was so long ago, it felt to him. They saw each other just before he had to leave,
<br>Elyas came to say goodbye to Asher in the monastsery where Ogerius was hiding
<br>Asher before sending him off to Asta.
<br>Saratsu looked down for a moment, back on the letter, "No there is no mention of
<br>your brother's work. I have told you everything that is written here."
<br>Could Saratsu be lying to him? Asher looked into Saratsu's eyes, no sign of any
<br>emotion but empathy. Didn't he want to tell Asher the cold hard truth? How could he
<br>be sure? He needed to get home to find out the truth, but how? "Thank you for your
<br>troubles. Could you write another letter to my family then?"
<br>"Of course, Asher", he said and grabbed a new piece of paper. "What would you like
<br>to write to your father and brother?"<br></p>
