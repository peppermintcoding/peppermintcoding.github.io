            <p>Prologue
<br>
<br>
<br>"Can I trust you?", she asked.
<br>"You don't have to", the man said. His wet, black leather armor shone with the light
<br>of  hundreds  of  candles  spread  across  the  room.  His  face  shrouded  by  a  hood.
<br>"Everybody is in place. We never misses our target. You know that. Everybody will
<br>know it before long. We will look after everything when you are gone."
<br>The woman walked over to the middle of the throne room, her red hair swinging from
<br>side to side. It was a circular room, with a high hanging ceiling, where twenty men
<br>could comfortably stand on each others shoulders. The everlasting fire nurtured by
<br>the woman herself feeding of the wood that has been constantly supplied by her
<br>servants for twenty-five years. Raindrops falling from a hole in the ceiling onto the
<br>fire and turned into steam with a sizzling sound. She reached with her hand into the
<br>fire, her back to the man in black.
<br>It didn't hurt. It calmed her. This decision was the right one, or was it? Would it really
<br>make the world a better place or was it all in her mind? Would it even work? She
<br>knew of what they were capable off but still, a drop of doubt remained.
<br>"How do you want it to end?", he asked. They were alone. The words hanging in the
<br>room like smoke. She turned around facing him straight on, her eyes covered by a red
<br>strip of cloth. Underneath her eyes were empty, like her mind was. Did she want it all
<br>to end? Could she throw all the planning away, the sacrifices she had to make and not
<br>go through with it? Could she betray the Onkari and everyone else just like she
<br>betrayed the others?
<br>No. This was for the better of everyone. This was bigger than her or her sisters and
<br>brothers.
<br>"Tell me, do you know the story of Hardulan and Siphone?", she asked. The fire
<br>behind her fading further and further to darkness.
<br>"A love story if I recall correctly", he answered. "Like Siphone then?"
<br>A monent of doubt washed across her. So intense, so strong she held her breath. Her
<br>mind walked throught the reasons over and over again. A second passed. She was
<br>sure. She was calm. It would be for the best. It was her legacy she could offer the
<br>world.
<br>"Like Siphone then."<br></p>
