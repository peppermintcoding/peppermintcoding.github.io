            <p>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>
<br>Seven heart beats in ten seconds.
<br>Asher multiplied it by six. Forty-two beats per minute. She was getting worse again.
<br>He would need to speak with cleric Ogerius about her condition.
<br>His mother lying on her bed, the strong brown flowing hair faded into a mute gray,
<br>bones showed underneath her paper thick skin. Eyes sunken into their sockets with
<br>dark bags underneath them. He barely remembered her any different. Her breathing
<br>was shallow and silent, her chest barely moving.
<br>"Asher", her voice was like a soft rustle of the wind through wet leaves. Her eyes
<br>opened just enough for him to see blood.
<br>"Mother, I am here." He pressed her hand softly trying not to break her weak bones.
<br>"Your .. hair", she whispered. The rain outside thumping down onto the clay roof
<br>almost swallowed her words. His hair was a dark brown, just like her mother's had
<br>been. His face with a well defined jaw line for a seventeen year old made him popular
<br>with the girls in Yevum.
<br>"What's with my hair?", he asked. Silence. Her eyes still closed, her mouth half open.
<br>"Mother,  are  you  still  there?"  What  a  foolish  question  it was.  She  wasn't  there
<br>anymore. She was a mere shadow of herself. It had been two years since she had been
<br>able to leave the bed at all. A spark of hope, a bright light to pull away the dark
<br>clouds looming over their lives. It didn't last. It was a miracle in itself, that she
<br>survived  as  long  as  she  did.  But  in  the  end  the  disease  grew  stronger  again,
<br>swallowing her.
<br>"I need to go Mother", Asher said brushing of a few strains of hair from her face. For
<br>a moment he saw something in her face. Was it pain? She didn't have pain anymore,
<br>her body to weak to feel. Was it shame? Lying there on the bed in her own filth,
<br>unable to move or speak or care for herself. He shook it off. There was no reason to
<br>dwell on these things for too long, it made it even harder for him. He put a wet cloth
<br>to her lips and a few drops of water and mixed in medicine from the clerics flowed
<br>into her mouth. Her plate of wet bread crumbs was still half full and standing on the
<br>table beside her bed. Soon the straw underneath her would need changing again, it
<br>stank.
<br>Asher stood up, grabbed the plate and cloth with one last glance blowing over of
<br>what remained and went downstairs.
<br>"Is she any better", Elyas asked with childish hope in his voice. His green eyes eager
<br>and alive. Bread and chees on the wodden table with a pattern of stars across the top.
<br>Their father sitting across the table of Elyas silently eating his last bits.
<br>"She is doing a bit better today I think", Asher said avoiding his brothers eyes out of
<br>shame. Lying to him was the worst, but what could he do? He was the only one
<br>having any hope left and he wouldn't be the one who took that away from him. Not
<br>only for his brother but also for himself. He held onto it like it was the most precious
<br>item in the world. Worth more than an iron sword, well worth more than an army, a
<br>kingdom.
<br>"You are late again", his father grunted. John was a bulky, muscular man who got his
<br>physique from working at the lumber mill all his life. His rough hands let Asher's
<br>look like children hands. He knew these hands too well. He never asked how their
<br>mother was doing. Sometimes Ashen though he didn't care about her at all anymore,
<br>he just wanted her gone. But he never forbid him to tend to her, to feed her or to
<br>change her clothes and bed straw. At least on some level he hadn't given up yet.
<br>"Try some of the bread", Elyas said. "I made it myself yesterday and Rollant let me
<br>take it with. It's not even burned this time, look." He held the rest of the bread in the
<br>air and turned it so he could see its perfect crust. How fast he learned working for the
<br>lord's cook.
<br>"Leave the bread and cheese, Asher. There is no time. I won't let you be late for work
<br>again."
<br>Asher quickly grabbed his green raincoat made out of leather and sealed with wax.
<br>He walked over to his little brother, kissed him on the head and got an almost serious
<br>angry, "Ey, I am too old for this now." His father already out the door, he followed
<br>quickly into the rain.
<br>It was normal for Yevum to have rain at least eight days out of ten. But it was that
<br>way everywhere. He knew of no place where it didn't rain so much and he didn't want
<br>to have it differently. The rain was part of their life just as everything else. The
<br>church wanted to make them believe, the rain was punishment for their sins. God
<br>avoided looking at his creation, banning them from sight with dark rain clouds. The
<br>simply folk didn't believe in it. Sometimes rain was just rain and nothing more.
<br>With hands in his side pockets, he walked after his father to the lumber yard always
<br>making sure there was enough space between them. His green rain coat covered
<br>almost his entire body, reaching down underneath his knees and ending just high
<br>enough to not drag through the dirt. Deep trenches on either side of the sloped road
<br>made  sure  the  water  had  somewhere  to  go  and  not  make  the  roads  into  a
<br>untraversable mess.
<br>Reaching the lumber yard he arrived before his father. He would, as he did every day,
<br>stop by the Singing Starling inn where he got his first beer of the day. It was always
<br>stocked with the famous strong beer from Raspborrow. That rainin' man.
<br>Luckily for his father the lumber yard had always enough work to pay enough to feed
<br>a family and a father's questionable habits. The rain always ruined something. The
<br>hundreds of wood bridges spanning over from tiny creaks to big flowing rivers were
<br>in  constand  need  of  repairing.  The  wood  didn't  last  long  in  these  conditions,
<br>eventhough they tried to make them last longer with oils and wax. The water and
<br>wind always found a way through.
<br>The other men hacking and sawing at the lumber nodded towards him when they saw
<br>Asher. He nodded back. His work was not sawing lumber or felling trees, but to carve
<br>wood into intricate figures and patterns. Not a man's kind of work for many. He was
<br>sitting for hours on a chair, or standing working away with his knives and tools to
<br>carve away at the wood. Nicely covered by a roof from the rain and with four walls
<br>protecting him against the winds. Many of the other men needed to go out into the
<br>woods.
<br>He sat down in his work station, the smell of freshly cut wood in the air, and got to
<br>work on a small chest with an unfolding forest oneither of its sides. The wood spoke
<br>to him, or so he felt when working. He didn't learn from masters of this craft, there
<br>was  never  anyone  capable  of  doing  what  he  could  in  all  of  Yevum.  Maybe
<br>somewhere in the bigger cities he could have found someone else, but here he learned
<br>it on his own. Starting out as a child with a knife he got from his father for his fifth
<br>birthday, he began to shape wood into things he saw out in nature or at home. His
<br>mother was still well and lively back then. The memory hurt him. His mind oftened
<br>began to wander to different times when his father was a different man, his mother a
<br>different woman. A time without his brother Elyas.
<br>Away with these thoughts. He needed to concentrate on his work.
<br>After four hours of work, his hands began to ache. Sawdust and scraps of wood piling
<br>up next to his feet, it was time for lunch break. The men all went to the Singing
<br>Sterling to get their lunch meal, and for some a bit of beer too. Or in Asher's father's
<br>case more of the same.
<br>Entering the inn, Asher hung his soaked rain coat to dry on the wall. The smell of wet
<br>hair, sweat and freshly cooked deer stew hang in the air. The noise was almost
<br>unbearable, loud laughter, angry discussions, spoons on clay bowls and clanks of
<br>glasses smashing together. The low hanging ceiling supported by dark brown wodden
<br>beams made the place look smaller than it actually was. Not a single nail was seen
<br>anywhere wether on the support structure or the furniture. They had to manage
<br>without any iron nails, iron was too precious.
<br>He took one of the free tables near one of the corners quite far away from the fire, sat
<br>down and waited for Ameline to bring him some of that delicious stew. It normally
<br>had little meat in it but the herbs and spices made it good nevertheless. With grain
<br>and other vegetable it was hearty and filling too.
<br>Ameline came out from the kitchen carrying ten bowls of stew on a large plate. Her
<br>hair as blond as the sun when it finally showed behind a curtain of clouds. Freckles
<br>covering her cheeks and nose and even some other parts of her body, but only Asher
<br>knew. She saw him sitting alone, smiled at him but served some of the other men
<br>first. Asher felt cold, eventhough the air was warm and thick from dozens of bodies
<br>cramped into a small space. Hopefully he wouldn't get rainfever. But that was amost
<br>impossible. Only children got rainfever and he was an adult now.
<br>After serving all of the other men, some from the lumber yard, some soldiers and
<br>some women from the weaving mill, Ameline walked over to Asher's table holding
<br>only one steaming bowl in her hand. She sat down with a bright smile. Her white and
<br>blue working dress followed her figure and covered her neck up to her chin as it was
<br>tradition for women to do so.
<br>"I hope you like it", she said. "My mother let me do it all by mself this time. Nobody
<br>complained yet but I feel like I could give them anything mildly resembling a warm
<br>stew and they will eat it all to the last spoon."
<br>After taking one slow spoon full to his mouth, he sniffed and put it in. His face a
<br>grimace of disgust and pain. "Oh stop that you rainin' fool", she giggled.
<br>"In all honesty", he said, "I think it is better than your mother's." It really was. A slice
<br>of bread went with it.
<br>"Well, thanks for the lie." Still smiling at him she added, "But I will take it. Tell me,
<br>will you come to Balin's barn later tonight? My mother said I could go." She tried to
<br>put some strains of her blond hair out of her face, but it fell right back in front of it.
<br>"You know I will be there if you are. But I can't stay long, you know why."
<br>"Yes", she sighed, "but we at least have a little time to enjoy ourselves. I will wear
<br>my new blue dress with white stitchings. My mother worked for weeks on it. It is so
<br>beautiful."
<br>"I can't wait to see it", he said with honest curiosity in his eyes.
<br>"I have to go now" she said giving him a quick kiss on the cheek and ran off towards
<br>the kitchen. Asher looked after her with a smile on his worried face. He looked
<br>through the room, searching for his father. He saw him with a bunch of the other men,
<br>drinking beer. Probably not his first sadly. He worried about tonight. Ameline in a
<br>beautiful new dress, dancing and singing. It sounded so seductive, he couldn't not go.
<br>They would manage like they always did.
<br>After washing himself outside the house, Asher dried himself of next to the fire. On
<br>the backside of their house one side of the roof would slope down to one edge and
<br>release a constant stream of cold rain water. It was cold but he was used to it. The fire
<br>would drive out the last of his goosebumps soon. Elyas wasn't home yet. He was
<br>always working longer hours than him and their father. His father wasn't home. A
<br>pleasant detail.
<br>He didn't have many clothes, because his mother was unable to sew anything for
<br>years, he had to manage with what they had and with what money he made from
<br>working. A pair of brown trousers which were a bit too short, a white tunic with
<br>ruffles on his shoulders and long sleeves to cover his arms. Eventhough the rain made
<br>it feel a lot colder than it actually was, a simple tunic would keep him warm enough
<br>when he was in a dry place. For the last touch he fished one coal out of the fire, let it
<br>cool before he used it, and drew the contour of his lower and upper eye lid with a
<br>thick black line. A bowl filled with water acting as a mirror.
<br>Grabbing his green raincoat he walked out the door and made his way across the
<br>town to Balin's barn. The old farmer hosted dance gatherings every time he felt like
<br>it. Despite his age Balin lived and breathed for dancing and singing.
<br>Faint music squeezed its way through the falling rain and made Asher quicken his
<br>steps. He didn't have much time left. In a couple of hours his brother would come
<br>home and he wanted to be there before him. But there was still time to enjoy the
<br>gathering with Ameline.
<br>Entering the barn, the smell of hay, cows and beer in the air, loud music, laughter and
<br>singing, he hung his coat on the wall next to all the others to dry. Scanning the room
<br>there were about thirty people here. Young and old alike and in the midst of all,
<br>Ameline in her blue dress with white details across her chest and a black belt tieing it
<br>together at her waist. Her neck covered by blue cloth. She was dancing with her
<br>father, not noticing Asher had arrived. He made his way through the crowd and
<br>Ameline stopped mid turn when she saw him. A smile washed over her face, she
<br>whispered something in her father's ear, he bowed slowly, nodded towards Asher and
<br>walked away looking for a new partner or something to drink.
<br>"You made it", she shouted trying to battle against the noise.
<br>"I wouldn't have missed it for anything", he said. "You look absolutely stunning in
<br>that dress." She blushed slightly and held a hand towards her mouth. Little blue
<br>threads were woven inbetween her hair. Her eyes glowing in a muted blue as well.
<br>And then they danced and danced until their feet hurt but they didn't stop. Laughter,
<br>singing and the occasional fragments of sentences shouted into each others ears
<br>trying to stand up to the noise in the barn. It was a time to relax, a time for happiness,
<br>a time to let go of everything else and forget for a moment his family. And Asher did.
<br>He knew he would feel guilty afterwards enjoying this moment as much as he did,
<br>but he didn't care. With Ameline in his arms he was beginning to feel alive again.
<br>Ameline's dress was moving with them as they danced, her laughter ringing in his
<br>ears and before he knew it, he was smiling himself. Laughing even. Her mouth
<br>slightly open, sweat shining on her forehead, she seemed the most beautiful girl in all
<br>of Yevum. He knew the stories of queens who blinded others with their beauty but
<br>how could they even come close to comparing with Ameline? No, nobody could.
<br>Over the noise he shouted in her ear, he wanted to go outside for a bit. She happily
<br>accepted and they went over to grab their raincoats. Her's was brown. The rain hadn't
<br>stopped, unsurprisingly so. They walked besides the Haythorn river, one of Yevums
<br>biggest. Asher didn't know all of the names for all the creaks and rivers carving their
<br>way throught the rocky land like long blue snakes, but the bigger ones everybody
<br>knew. It rain less now, only being a light mist of tiny raindrops.
<br>"My birthday isn't long off now", Ameline said the hood shrouding her face as she
<br>spoke. He knew what that meant. She didn't need to say it out loud, which was
<br>frowned upon anyway. On her sixteenth birthday, Ameline would reach adolescence
<br>and with that she was allowed to wed. He already got something planned for the big
<br>proposal, but first he would need her father's and mother's blessing. He could only
<br>ask them after her birthday though.
<br>"I know", was everything he could say. His throat tightening and heartbeat rising.
<br>They were fooling around with each other for months now, and the occasional kiss on
<br>the cheek was a good sign. But would Ameline want to wed him? Or was she talking
<br>about something else?
<br>She nudged him with her elbow, playfully. The contact of her arm with his side
<br>brought him out of his thoughts. The water rushing down the riverbed beside them,
<br>about five metres wide.
<br>He stumbled to his right exaggerating the blow immensly. She laughed, "Stop that
<br>you ranin' fool." She nudged him again, this time actually harder, Asher stumbled to
<br>the right, the steep cliff towards the river, a two meter drop, coming closer and closer.
<br>His boot on the edge.
<br>"Come back from that ledge before you fall into the water", she said. Looking at him.
<br>Her eyes sparkling or so it looked for Asher.
<br>"You are right", he said lifting up one foot to get closer to Ameline. With his right
<br>foot in the air, his left foot lost its grip on the ground. A second of panic washed over
<br>Asher's body. His arms flailing trying to prevent the inevitable. Ameline openeing her
<br>mouth to shout, reaching with her arms towards him. It was too late. He fell.
<br>His back hit the rocky ledge first, the pain made him moan but before a sound could
<br>escape his open mouth the cold water surrounded him. He couldn't hear anything but
<br>the sound of rushing water. The current pulled at him, his head hitting the rocky
<br>ground making him lose all perception of what was up and what was down. He
<br>struggled trying to pull himself up, his lungs beginning to hurt. It was too dark to see,
<br>everything direction seemed to go deeper and deeper into the water. He turned and
<br>turned, panic rising. His lungs at their threshhold. He wouldn't make it much longer.
<br>Then, a moment of clarity. The water didn't seem cold anymore. He was floating now,
<br>he had given up the struggle. He was calm. His body had given up, why? He saw his
<br>father putting him up onto his shoulders to see something of the show when the
<br>theater group was in town. His mother looking with a smile at them. Elyas as a baby,
<br>so small and innocent. How could anyone give him any fault? His father beginning to
<br>drink more and more. His mother fading away.
<br>Then darkness took him. He didn't feel anxious, no he felt warm and welcome. Was
<br>this death, he wondered. The air around him, or whatever was around him in this dark
<br>abyss, getting warmer and warmer. He felt like he decended downwards, not that he
<br>would feel any resistance, no wind blowing around his face, nothing. The dark around
<br>him, smooth and without any marker to give him a sense of place, but he knew he
<br>was sinking to the bottom of this. He looked down and saw something come close to
<br>him, something red and yellow. Flames, giant flames licking at the not-air, filling the
<br>bottom of this dark abyss. Asher saw them coming closer and closer, his body felt to
<br>hot, sweat forming on his forehand and chest, back and arms. Everything felt too hot.
<br>The flames drawing closer, so close he could feel their mighty heat. He had never
<br>seen anything like this. It wasn't looking like a gigantic fire, no it was more like the
<br>fire was a living thing, waiting for him at the bottom. He tried to shout, but no words
<br>came from his mouth. The silence around him hurt his ears. The flames were so close.
<br>It hurt, it burned him. The small fingers of the fire touched his feet, burning through
<br>his boots and burning him alive. He tried to scream and paddle away, like he was in
<br>water. He wanted to swim away, but the flames drew him closer.
<br>He felt a sudden blow to his chest, his body arching forward trying to minimize the
<br>pain. Water streaming out of his mouth, some vomit came with it. He breahted in
<br>deeply, he couldn't get enough. Ameline crouching next to him, tears in her eyes and
<br>his hand in hers. A familiar man towering over him.
<br>"What..", he coughed some more water. His throat felt raspy.
<br>"Fished you out of the river, lad", the man said. "Was a close one. You hit one of the
<br>pillars of the bridge. You rainin' lucky, boy. Fished out a couple of lads in my life,
<br>women too, but I thought you were gone for sure hanging like a sack around that
<br>pillar." He knew the man, it was Salan, one of the men working with his father at the
<br>lumber yard.
<br>He saw movement to his right but the slap hit him. With a ringing in his head he
<br>looked towards Ameline.
<br>"Why.."
<br>"You rainin' fool had me rainin' worried there." She was still crying, her whole body
<br>sobbing.
<br>"Well I leave you two to it then", Salan said. "You two should celebrate. Something
<br>like this doesn't happen often. Take it as a blessing of the Enlightening." He winked at
<br>Asher, walking away. Just then he noticed them man was drunk, he couldn't keep a
<br>straight line. He was gone too quickly, Ashe still unable to use his voice, too late to
<br>thank him now. He would have to do that in the morning then.
<br>"I am sorry", he said to Ameline.
<br>"Don't be sorry. Promise me you will never, ever do that again?"
<br>"I promise." And he meant it.
<br>"Even if the clouds stop raining?"
<br>"Even then."
<br>"Let's go back to the barn", she said. "I want you out of these wet clothes immediatly.
<br>Don't want to lose you to a rainfever after all this."
<br>"Oh, do you?", he said with a smirk.
<br>"Don't get any ideas. I am still angry at you. You could have died. Like a fool falling
<br>into a river. What kind of way to go is that?"
<br>Asher stood up, his clothes soaked with water, his fair clinging to his skin and his
<br>body shivering. They walked silenty over to the barn, he glancing over to her every
<br>now and then. Her face sternly looking foward, shrouded by the hood. How could
<br>that has happened? A beautiful evening ruined just because he wanted to make a little
<br>joke. Gone were the feelings of laughter and dance, back was the normal Asher.
<br>Back at the barn some people laughed at Asher when he came in soaked to his
<br>underpants. Ameline insisted on removing every bit of clothing save his underpants
<br>and dry them next to one of the fires that lit and warmed the room. The dark was
<br>slowly creeping in. The sun was setting in the distance.
<br>"Do you need a blanket or something", she asked. Her face looked concerned but her
<br>cheeks were reddening.
<br>"No, it's okay like this. The fire will warm me right up", he said.
<br>They sat there silently watching the fire dance around the wood. Smoke rising in
<br>swirls towards the high ceiling. The music, laughter and singing remained in the
<br>background.
<br>"I really thought you would die", she whispered. Barely enough to hear above the
<br>noise but it hit him like she had screamed it in his face. He thought he had died too.
<br>He got a little closer towards her, their arms almost touching. "I have big dreams for
<br>us both when we are married." It was not custom to talk about marrigage if the
<br>woman was not sixteen yet.
<br>"What kind of dreams?"
<br>"Well, you know. I see a house for us and our children. Three of them. One daughter
<br>as beaituful as me and two sons as talented as you. You made all our furniture
<br>yourself with images and patterns we both love." She hesitated. "I see you happy with
<br>only smiles on your face."
<br>Only  smiles?  He  couldn't  imagine  how  that  would  feel.  A tear  running  down
<br>Ameline's cheek. He put his hand to her cheek and she put her head into his hand. A
<br>warm feeling originating in his chest, filled his body. He felt it rise to his face, his
<br>legs and hands. It was so invigorating he stopped shivering.
<br>The first thing he noticed was the scream. Ameline was screaming, pushing his hand
<br>away  from  her  face  just  to  scream  again.  It  went  into  Asher's  bones  he  didn't
<br>understand. Then he noticed the smell. Burned flesh. Amelines left side, the side his
<br>hand was one, burned to the bone. The music stopped, people gathering around them.
<br>Ameline's father rushing towards her, holding his daughte in his arms. The croud was
<br>silent, save her screams. Asher looked around him. Angry faces watchin him, some
<br>spitting on the ground next to him.
<br>"Look", a woman shouted, "his hair is turning red. Elightening, protect us from your
<br>accursed."
<br>It couldn't be. These stories were myths, dating back thousands of years. He wasn't
<br>one of them, his hair. It was no longer the same brown his mother used to have. It was
<br>a vibrant deep red.
<br>No, he thought. Please not me, not now.
<br>Ameline.<br></p>
