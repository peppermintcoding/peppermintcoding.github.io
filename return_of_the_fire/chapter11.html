            <p>Chapter 10
<br>
<br>
<br>"Aelana, why is it that so many people here are suspicious of me?" The two women
<br>were getting ready for the day, washing off the night and clothing themselves. Malina
<br>wore for the first day, her new garments. She decided to expose her neck and not
<br>cover it by unnecessary cloth. She wore tight pants with iron beads knitted into the
<br>fabric, that didn't hang on to every little branch that stuck out from a tree or bush.
<br>Over it a short sleeve shirt made out of leather and fur. It looked good on her, Malina
<br>decided. The cloth hugging her body, making her feel exposed but confident. She
<br>touched her naked neck and felt shame rising from inside, but she fought it back. This
<br>was going to be the first day of her new life. She would embrace it and not dwelve in
<br>the past too much.
<br>"They don't like lowlanders. They bring trouble." Aelana put on her boots and hid two
<br>knives in them.
<br>"I heard that before," Malina said. "But why is that? What kind of trouble would I
<br>bring them? I couldn't hurt anybody here, even if I wanted. I didn't learn to fight or
<br>kill. I learned to be a lady, that is of no use here and of no danger to others."
<br>"It is not your ability to kill they fear. Maybe fear is a strong word for it anyway. The
<br>first forest people might have been lowlanders, too, fleeing from their lands into the
<br>arms of the trees. But that has been hundreds, probably even thousands of years. To
<br>them you are a total stranger, still."
<br>"So what can I do to change that?"
<br>"Well, you done well with wearing something more appropriate for this enviroment,
<br>but it won't be enough. You would need to start a relationship with someone here,
<br>most likely. But even then it could take years before they accept you as one of them."
<br>"They seem to accept you alright, even without courting a man."
<br>"Right. I am different." She grabbed her bow and a couple of arrows from the rack. "I
<br>bring back food. More food than any other hunting group, that's why they don't
<br>bother me and I don't bother them. We live together because it is safer. If that safety
<br>ends, I am gone as fast as a sunny day."
<br>"You are bluntly honest, I see."
<br>"Always have."
<br>"So then tell me, what's your story. I know nothing about you. Only things I know is
<br>you can hunt and are a lowlander like me."
<br>"Right, and that's all you need to know and all you will ever know about you. I need
<br>to get going."
<br>"Why go early if you won't need the whole day for hunting?"
<br>"I like the mornings for hunting, that's all." Aelana left the hut through the only
<br>entrance there was. A dagger hanging on her side, sheathed in black leather with gold
<br>and iron engravings on it. As far as Malina remembered, it was the only weapon
<br>Aelana had never hung on the rack or left alone in the hut. Seemed to be something
<br>with emotional value to her. Something from her past. But all Malina could do was
<br>speculate. The woman was like a mud wall when it came to conversation. She would
<br>definitely not be fun at a dinner party.
<br>The familiar rain greeted Malina when she left the hut herself, falling softly on her
<br>skin and head. The sound was soothing and refreshing. Sleeping on the hard floor was
<br>not easy to get used to, but now she felt more refreshed than she had ever before.
<br>Like in her old life, something had been suffocating her to the point where she was
<br>unable to breathe deeply. The air felt fresh and clean while she breathed with her
<br>whole body, soaking in the energy.
<br>Lately, Malina was eating her breakfast alone. Karman and Choco had explained to
<br>her, that the forest wasn't providing in a way it once did. So far from the center of it,
<br>it was even worse. They didn't tell her anything about why they were living so far to
<br>the corner of the forest and Malina understood that it was a topic neither of the tribes
<br>people wanted to talk to her about. Fruits, nuts and other foraging food was hard to
<br>get and so they were forced to hunt more than prior. But hunting was going slowly,
<br>deer were thinning in the forest and smaller animals weren't enough for a couple of
<br>dozen people. So they ate their food on the way to their hunting grounds, leaving only
<br>the children, some guards, Ruse and Malina herself at the camp. It was the only way
<br>they could assure the survival of the tribe.
<br>Luckily her teaching went better with every day. Zaral had persuaded the other two
<br>children, Ezir and Mon, to join them for writing and the children learned quickly.
<br>Zaral was the fastest of them, always asking questions about everything. The others
<br>were a bit more reserved but Malina could tell from their developing skills, they were
<br>listening to everything.
<br>Today Malina decided, to teach the children more about how to write down traditions
<br>and customs of their people. Karman had asked her to do so, in order for them to have
<br>something to look back on. How festivals were celebrated, or how hunting was done,
<br>how the old were honored and how the gods were praised. Malina learned a lot
<br>herself during that time, about what made these people so different from her own or
<br>herself.
<br>"What do we learn today," Zaral ask eagerly. She couldn't stay still and jumped up
<br>and down next to Malina, pulling on her sleeves. Ezir with his deep blue eyes which
<br>made him look so much more mysterious than he actually was. He felt more, simple,
<br>to Malina. Mon on the other hand was kind of indifferent about it. She was a year
<br>younger than Zaral, but instead of putting her heart into learning, she spend most of
<br>her time complaining about that this won't bring food for the tribe and she would
<br>rather learn something more important. She did participate though, which didn't make
<br>much sense for Malina. Why be so negative but still participate?
<br>"We will learn some new words today," Malina said. They were standing under a
<br>selfmade leaf roof. The children had build after the rain had started again. It kept the
<br>four people dry and didn't wash away their markings. "I thought about festives today.
<br>What kind of festives do you celebrate? We will then try to write down the words
<br>necessary to describe these things?"
<br>"Why would we want to do that?" Mon asked with her arms crossed in front of her
<br>chest. Her dark hair braided with iron rings in them. "We already know how they are
<br>celebrated. Why spend time writing something what everybody knows already?"
<br>"That's a good question. Maybe you know if, and maybe everybody else knows it
<br>right now, but in the future they might not. Maybe there will be a discussion about
<br>how things used to be and then you can go back and read what was written these
<br>days. So there is no room for any differing opinions. Written words don't change, how
<br>people see the world can change. Our memories sometimes play tricks on you."
<br>The  memory  hit  her  hard  in  the  stomach.  The  memory  of  her  father.  Was  she
<br>remembering  things  differently  too?  Was  he  actually  a  good  man?  Or  did  she
<br>remember him better than he actually was? She felt he was a different man back in
<br>the days when Malina was younger. She always thought the dreamshrooms and her
<br>mother's death changed him, but then again did it? Malina remembered her father
<br>hitting her as a child when she was crying. She had no idea why she was crying and
<br>no idea why he hit her, but it was vivid and hurtful. It happened often. Her father.
<br>"Malina?" Zaral asked concerned. "What is it?"
<br>"Oh nothing," Malina answered. "Where were we? Ah yes." She put these memories
<br>as far back in her head as she could. He might have been unfair but he was a good
<br>man. The problem were these rainin' shrooms. She would find a way to change that,
<br>find a way to get her father off these poisonous things.
<br>Malina was about to introduce to the kids the symbol for god, when a horn cut
<br>through the constant rain background noise. It was long and deep. The children froze
<br>in their actions and looked to where the sound was coming. Malina had no idea was
<br>going on.
<br>"What is-" but Malina couldn't finish her question.
<br>"We need to get back," Zaral shouted and grabbed Ezir and Mon with her hands and
<br>dragged them back to the camp. Malina followed unsure what was happening.
<br>One of the guards, a tall young man with a short boy and a sword at his side, black
<br>hair and long hair, was waiting for them.
<br>"They found us," he shouted towards them. "You have to run. Go south to the border,
<br>they won't expect you to run that way. We will hold them off. Cover your tracks as
<br>best you can."
<br>"What is happening?" Malina asked but the man was already off, running towards
<br>where the horn had been blown. He ran fast, water splattering behind him.
<br>The children ran off, south where Malina had come from.
<br>Zaral looked back, "Come on Malina, the Lival tribe has found us. We need to go. We
<br>can't fight them without Karman and the others. Come on, hurry." And Malina did.
<br>She didn't know what was going on, but this child seemed to know what to do. So she
<br>followed them south, away from her new home.
<br>While running the kids tried to cover their tracks with walking on fallen trees and
<br>stumps to not leave a mark and Malina did her best to do the same, she slipped and
<br>almost fell, but she found her balance just at the precarious time. The children were
<br>fast and Malina had difficulty keeping up. Her body wasn't made for this. She never
<br>had to run anywhere, but as a small child maybe. But even then she did other things
<br>than play in the woods like these children. It was diheartening to know that little
<br>children were better at something than herself.
<br>Zaral stopped and told everybody they should hold and breathe for a few minutes.
<br>The others did as they were told. This seemed to be not the first time this had
<br>happened.
<br>"Who are these Lival," Malina asked.
<br>"It was a neighbouring tribe," Zaral explained, "when were living deeper in the forest.
<br>We were good friends once but things changed and now they declared war on us."
<br>"For what?"
<br>"Because Karman is an idiot," Mon said, her eyes furious. "If it wasn't for him
<br>everything would be fine and we wouldn't live in exile near the border."
<br>"Let's not fight and keep going," said Zaral, who seemed to understand the anger. She
<br>looked at Mon with a certain look, Malina wasn't able to read herself.
<br>The sun was almost at its peak and Malina was thinking about Aelana. This was
<br>normally the time when she would come back from her hunting. Would she encounter
<br>the Lival and fight them? She probably would run away, go on and live with someone
<br>else, like she put it.
<br>Another horn sung close to Malina, towards the camp.
<br>"What does that mean?" she asked and saw the terrified faces of the three children.
<br>"They found our trail. We need to hide," Zaral's voice not more than a whisper, her
<br>eyes as wide as her face.
<br>"Where would we hide," Malin asked but the kids were alreay climbing one of the
<br>trees. Swiftly and without apparent effort the three children vanished in the canopy of
<br>the tree.
<br>"What are you rainin' waiting for," Zaral whispered from above. "Come on."
<br>Malina climbed up the tree with the help of a lower hanging branch. She put the feet
<br>towards the trunk and slowly made her way up the tree. Her arms were shivering and
<br>her breath already fast and shallow. Her legs hurt from the running and she was
<br>losing grip on the slippery bark. She knew what would happen before it actually
<br>happened. Malina was slipping on the bark, her arms unable to hold her weight and
<br>she lost hold of the branch as well. With a hard landing she fell to the ground, the
<br>bones in her bottom hurt. He hands full of mud and leaves. Like this she would never
<br>be able to climb that tree. She wouldn't find a hold.
<br>And there she saw them. A group of five men running through the woods. Still quite
<br>some way away but close enough to see them shine between the trees. All were
<br>holding bows with an arrow already on the bowstring. Was this how it all would end.
<br>Malina made a quick decision and jumped up from where she sat, shouted as loud as
<br>she could and ran off further south. Branches cutting her cheeks, she jumped over
<br>fallen trees, ferns almost brought her down and the damp and soft ground underneath
<br>swallowed her steps. She didn't look back. All she could hope for, was to lure the men
<br>away from the three children. At least she could do that.
<br>A faint breeze blew over her face. Malina looked back saw the men so close to her,
<br>she could already see their faces. She held her breath. This was the end. Two of them
<br>drew their bows. She could dodge behind a tree, for sure. But what would it matter?
<br>A shemen appeared behind one of the men, who had drawn his bow, a shemen with a
<br>Sinbu fur on their shoulder, the iron blade cut through the man's throat and then it
<br>vanished. It happened so fast. When the first of the five men touched the floor, his
<br>throat full of crimson colored blood, the shemen cut the last one's throat just like the
<br>others. The men fell to their deaths in a quick succession like there were strings
<br>attached to them and if one fell the others were destined to fall themselves.
<br>And there Malina saw Aelana stand over the last of the five men, her blade dripping
<br>with blood, her gaze fixed on Malina.
<br>A single word escaped her mouth. Not more than a whisper, a breeze of air maybe,
<br>"Onkari."<br></p>
