            <p>"Livia, come on. What is taking you so long?", my mother cried from downstairs. I was finishing up my make-up, trying to get my eyeliner just right. I had borrowed some of Anastasia's make up for the big night. She had told me I can keep it all, she had already forgotten that she had all this stuff. My bathroom was packed full with the weirdest things. I had put on some make up from time to time but nothing elaborate. She had taught me one look, the one I was trying to replicate right now. Today, I was not expecting any help from her. She was probably throwing bottles at the wall at home because of her nerves.
I put on a little lipstick last to round everything out. I went for a very light and muted shade of red. It was actually something I had to get myself because Anastasia was only wearing very bold colors and her left overs had nothing I felt comfortable wearing. Looking in the mirror I faked a smile to see how I looked. There was no reason to be this nervous, I told myself. I had not part in the play tonight. The costumes looked good and noone was paying much attention to that anyways. I was nervous anyway. We had been meeting almost every day after school to practice Anastasia's lines. By now, I could probably play her part by heart.
I walked down the stairs and did my best not to trip on the hem of my dress. I had begged my mum to go shopping with me so I could wear something new for today. It was so much easier than I had expected, she was onboard almost immediately. It had taken me a whole saturday to decide which one to buy. I had not worn a dress since I was a little girl but I wanted to look good for today. I also wanted to fit in, everybody else on the drama club had been talking about what extravagant new outfit they had bought for the premiere. It was a simple, long dark green dress. I had tried to convince my mum to let me buy a dress with an open back because I thought I looked good on me but it was too promiscious for my mother. Shocking. It was tailored in at the waist and flaired out over my thighs which gave me a fuller figure than I actually had. It went down to my ankles and also covered my upper arms. But moving in it felt like walking through water. The fabric moved in step with me, draping wonderfully down my body.
I rounded the last corner of the stairs and my parents stood there waiting for me. My mother put her hands in front of her face and called out how beautiful I looked and how proud she was. My father agreed but told us we were already running late.
In the car I tried to sit as still as possible to not wrinkle the dress. The headlight sped by over head and the night sky looked like it sparkled just for us.
We arrived to an almost full parking lot. At the entrance to the gym was a small queue and Mr. Yates was busy thanking everyone personally for coming. My mum started up a conversation with him immediately. She had no shame intrying to coaxe him into giving me a speaking role for the next play.
"I will go behind the stage already, you have your tickets?", I asked my parents. They nodded and my mother got right back into the rhythm again.
After I walked through the entry hallway I already saw rows of seats. All of them were chairs from different classrooms. We even made some of them VIP seats, which only meant they had light padding on them. I walked through the half full rows towards the stage. The play was not to start for almost twenty minutes, so many people had come very early. Some were at the bar getting something to drink to make the wait more bearable. I saw some of mums sipping on a glass of wine and I felt a strong desire to drink myself. It would calm my nerves for sure.
Then I saw her. Lara was behind the bar filling up glasses with wine. I had not idea she was capable of this, because I had never seen her use a glass for anything, especially not wine. I walked over to the bar through the rows of chairs, dodging the rows were people were already seated. She wore golden half-moon earrings tonight and a black blouse, which she had unbottoned further down than my mother would have ever allowed me too. I saw parts of her black bra.
"Hi, Lara", I said to her. She had not noticed me walking over, too busy pouring drinks.
She looked up and froze for a second before I saw a smile form on her lips. "Sorry, do I know you? I am looking for a friend of mine, Livia? Have you seen her? Your height, nerdy looking, never wears a dress, like ever."
"Fuck off", my cheeks started to burn. "What do you think?" I twirled around a little giving her a full view of my new dress. It made a satisfying ruffling noise when I moved.
"You look incredible in it. I mean it."
The other girls at the bar chimed in and said the same. It made me blush even harder.
"Thank you", I tried to laugh it off. "Have you seen Anastasia already? I wanted to wish her good luck for the show."
"Yeah, she is backstage getting into her costume. Do you want to watch the play with your parents or do you stay with me backstage?"
I had not thought about it. It did not occur to me that the others were not watching the play from the audience seats.
"Backstage with you of course", I replied. "I will find you before it starts."
"Before you go", Lara said and poured me a glass of wine but into normal glass for soda. "Here! Some juice to calm the nerves." I grabbed the glass and thanked her. I walked towards the stage, feeling Lara's eyes following me like hot daggers every step of the way.
Anastasia was in full costume when I entered behind the curtain. She was in a extravagant victorian dress with lots of subtle details. Her make up was even more heavy than usual so she would not wash out in the stage light.
"Oh Livia, hi", she squealed when she saw me. We hugged tightly and I wished her the best for her performance. She had not a hint of anxiety on her. She felt calmer than anyone around, calmer than me.
"I am so excited for the show today", she said. "It will be a glamorous night, I can feel it."
"It will be because of you", I answered and we hugged again. I left her for some warm up excercises. Now I only needed to tell my parents I was watching the show from the stage and not with them.
I found them already at their seats. When my mum saw me coming she waved me over to them. They had been sitting their silently, no drink in their hands. While all the others around were chatting up their neighbours, my parents had kept to themselves.
"It looks wonderful, Livia", my mum said. "And this Mr. Yates is a very understanding teacher I find. He said he was very impressed with your talented work for the costumes this play. I told you it would come in handy."
"Yes, mum", I snorted.
"Come on sit down, is it starting soon?" She patted the seat next to her.
"Ehm, actually it is kind of a tradition that the rest of the team watches the show from backstage. Especially if something goes wrong with one of the costumes I can fix it quickly. So I will be watching with the others from backstage, if that is alright with you guys?"
"Oh, I thought we were watching it together but I understand. It makes sense. We can meet after it ends."
"Thanks mum. Hope you guys like it. And watch out for Anastasia, the female lead, she is a good friend of mine and worked really hard for this."
I waved awkwardly to them and left to walk over to the bar. Lara and the others were finishing up, the bar was being closed down during the play and reopened afterwards. Miss Kavanaugh oversaw the closing up, especially the alcohol. She must have dipped out for a second when Lara had filled my glass up. With all the excitement I had forgotten about it entirely. I took my first big sip from it. It tasted terrible, since I was so accostumed to Anastasia's mother's wine collection. But it made me feel better almost immediately.
"Come on, it is about to start", Lara said and I followed her towards the stage. She had unlike almost any other girl opted to wear a pair of straight cut wool pants. She even wore her normal boots today.
All the others from the drama club, who did not have any speaking parts in the play gathered to the side of the stage. The curtain was still down and the final touched were made on the set. The actors got into positions and Mr. Yates was about to step in front of the curtain to introduce the play to everybody. We flashed Anastasia a quick thumbs up but she seemed to be completely in her character and did not notice us. I offered Lara a sip from my glass, which she gleefully took. She gulped down multiple times before handing it back to me.
The play went quite well for everybody, only a few times someone had to whisper the next line to get them back into it. Anastasia was perfect, she was her character during the play. It was like she had flipped a lever and now was no longer Anastasia but Lady Winsor. Lara and me exchanged gleeful glances whenever a tricky scene went by so perfectly.
During the break, Lara had to get back to the bar and I helped her out. My parents did not get up from their seats and I did not go over to them. The break was only twenty minutes, so it was over quickly. Lara whispered into my ear I should create a small diversion with Miss Kavanaugh so she could steal a bottle for us. I reminded her to also pick up a corkscrew this time but she only made a twisty motion with her hands. This wine had a screw cap.
I asked Miss Kavanaugh how she felt about the play today which was just enough to get her focus away from the wine stash and Lara got a bottle that she put into a handbag, which looked very much like Anastasia's. I had never seen Lara with a handbag before.
We walked back to the stage after Miss Kavanaugh closed up the bar, trying to act as natural as possible. I did my best but I kept on giggling. The one glass had done its job well. It was gone before the first scene had ended. Lara deposited the handbag in a corner, I gave her cover with my long dress so she could squat down and fill up our one soda glass with more wine. It was red wine this time.
"Why did you pick red wine?" I hissed. This was way harder to conceal since it left a deep red to purple tint on my lips. Even with my lipstick my parents or Mr. Yates would be able to see it if they looked for it.
"I did not look at the label. It is fine", Lara said and got back up.
"I can not Lara. If Mr. Yates sees it, I am dead."
Lara looked around and leaned in closer and whispered in my ear, "Do you want to go back in the prop room, nobody will see us there. I can tell you how the play ends." The hair on my neck stood up. Every word sent shivers down my whole body. I smelled her shampoo again so close to my nose. The golden ear rings shone in the light. I almost forgot to answer.
"Yes", I croaked and Lara pulled me by my hand towards the door of the prop room. She had already grabbed the bottle of wine with the other. At the door, we looked left and right but everyone had their eyes on the stage, so we snuck in quickly.
The room was almost empty compared to the last time we were here. A lot of the props were on stage or at the sides so it could be changed quickly. But there was still lots of left overs from the previous years and in the back, our couch and armchair with the barrel table was still there.
"If my parents find out they will kill me for real", I laughed as I sat down. The cushionion was soft underneath my dress. It flaired out and almost took up the whole couch. I tried to scoot it over so Lara had some place to sit but she sat down anyways, half on my dress. I did not mind a bit.
"We will be back before it ends. But we have some time before then. I have seen it so often by now, it is kind of a bore, right?"
"Especially with all of Anastasia's extra training shows."
"Oh, I will not miss those when it is finally over after today", Lara said and took a sip from the bottle she had opened up.
"I did like hanging out though", I said, "the three of us, I mean."
"Yeah, me too", Lara said. We were quiet for a moment and took a sip of our wine. I looked over at her. The wine had already left a little red line on her lips.
"See, the wine already shows on your lips", I said pointing at hers. "And you wanted to drink it in front of everyone. If my parents ever find out, I am dead."
"You think so?"
"Yours would not care", I asked and took another sip.
"They are not here tonight. I have not told them about it. They would not have come anyway, so-"
"Because you are not in the play itself?"
"No, no. My parents they just are not like yours, you know? They are not so big on school things, that is all." She looked at her boots which she swayed from side to side.
"I am sorry", I said.
"Let us not talk about it today, alright? It is a beautiful evening. A good play, cheap wine and you in an actual dress. Can this night get any better?" She laughed and I was not able to stop staring at her. When she laughed, her ears moved a little up and down.
"I drink to that", was all I could say and we toasted, me with my glass and she with the bottle. We both took a long gulp.
"So, is Anastasia always so calm at the premiere? I had expected a complete meltdown seconds before the curtain opened." I kept my eyes glued to my glass.
"Anastasia is a robot", Lara said, she pulled on the paper etiquette of the wine bottle. "Every time it is the same. Complete disaster during the weeks before the play but then she just stops and becomes this different person. Like she knows she needs to be confident to get on stage and perform and then she does it. I could never do it like her."
"I think you are pretty confident yourself."
"Maybe superficially", she said and continued to strip the bottle of the paper.
I rocked over a bit closer to her. Our thighs were touching slightly. She looked up from the bottle and she met my eyes. She looked more beautiful than ever in this dingy prop room light. The wine had stained her lips slightly.
"Your lips would betray you the second you step outside", I said. I was so close to her now, that I saw the individual lashes dance around her eyes. It was mesmerizing. Everything about her was.
"Yours are worse", she said. My mouth felt so dry I was about to cough from it. I took another sip from my wine but it did not help. It made it even worse.
"It might just be my make up though, everybody knows I am new to it anyways."
"Definitely not, but I like your make up tonight."
"Thanks", I croaked. I was sweating from every pore in my body. Suddenly the dress felt like a big blanket suffocating me. The fabric clung to my skin like wet plastic. But I was unable to keep my eyes from hers, her lips, her collar bone that peaked out from the blouse she was wearing. "We should get back to the stage. It is probably close to being over."
Lara looked down to the bottle again, her shoulders slumped a bit down. I had no idea why had said it and why so direct and cold.
"I mean-", but I had no idea how to finish it and looked at my hands again.
Lara went through her, or Anastasia's handbag, "Here", she said, "I can not let you go out like this. Remember, your parents will kill you and stuff." She had a tissue paper in her right hand. With her left hand she gently cupped my chin to hold me still and with her right hand she gently, with the slightest pressure, wiped the little bit of red wine from my lips. My body was shaking and I hated it more than anything in this moment. I was so shocked, not a single muscle in my body was still under my control. There was nothing in this world that could have pulled me from her. Her hands were so soft and gentle but we were fused together for those few heavenly seconds.
"Much better", she whispered, almost inaudible. She let go of my chin but the feeling of her hand on my skin stayed. My heart was pounding through my throat.
"I think you need some help, too", I said with a hoarse voice. I held out my hand for her to give me the tissue. It had a red tint, almost purple. She slowly put in my hand and looked at me with slightly parted lips.
With my left hand I grabbed her chin, just like she did before. It felt clumsy, not elegant like she had. With my right, trembling hand I began to wipe her lips. They had a lot more bounce to them than I had expected. Even underneath the tissue I felt how soft and full they were. I was so concentrated on her lips I only felt her eyes staring at me. I just wanted to pull back because I had finished up, she grabbed my left arm and held it there in place. She let her face fall heavy into my hand. My heart was pounding so hard the whole audience outside was sure to hear it. We locked eyes again and there was something I had never seen before from Lara. Without telling my body any of this, I lightly pulled her towards me, my right hand still awkwardly holding onto the dirty tissue.
Her lips met mine and it washed over my body like thousands of tiny fire ants. Every cell in my body yearned for more. I pulled her closer again, this time with more force with let us topple over, she on top of me and I underneath her. Our lips never parted. We kissed and I was sure I would never be able to stop again. Her hand grabbed my hair to pull me closer to her. The gentleness from the beginning was placed by hunger. I wanted to more. I wanted to be closer. I wanted more of her. I let go of the dirty tissue and cupped her right cheek. Our bodies melded into one and everything outside stopped to exist. I was-.
"Livia", a shrill cry knocked me back into reality. I sat up so quickly I must have knocked Lara back with my head. I looked up and I knew it was my mum standing there. She had just come around some of the other props and was looking straight at us with horror in her eyes. Her face was red like a tomatoe and behind her Mr. Yates stepped into view. The play must have already finished and we had missed the ending. This was not supposed to happen like this.
Without another word my mother stormed up to us, I got up immediately and tried to apologize to her and that we just forgot the time. She slapped me once in the face, I did not expect it and my face jerked to the side. She then grabbed me by my hand and dragged me out of the room. I got one last glance at Lara who was still sitting there with open mouth and wide eyes. It was burned into my memory because it was the last time I saw her.</p>
