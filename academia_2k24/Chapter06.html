            <h3>part two</h3>
<p>Lana del Rey was blasting from the speakers in my 1994 Honda Civic. I had cracked a window because it was burning hot and the AC was not working anymore, like so many other things in this car. I got it on my seventeenth birthday after begging my father to get me a car for months. And now, I was driving to orientation week for college. The street was lined with tall, heavy trees. Many oak trees hanging far over the street with spruce in between. Over the tree tops snowy mountain tops poked out. I had not seen more than two cars on this street for over an hour. I was not going to Harvard or Dartmouth like my mother had so meticously planned since the day she held that positive pregnancy test in her hands. I had decided on a small college, as far away from my parents as possible. Getting in was no problem at all, they even awarded me with a scholarship that payed almost all of my tuition for two years. Since my parents were not supporting me in this decision I had to get it done myself. At least in this my mother had helped me, somehow. Having all these extra curricular and stellar grades made it easy to get in.
Whisperridge was barely a town. It was in a vast valley, enclosed by forest and mountains. So isolated, the only people coming here were wanderers and loggers. But somehow, they build a private school here that later became a small college. After my parents moved me away because of the incident, as my mother called it from then onwards, I had dreamed about meeting Lara and Anastasia at college. We kept in touch, even though my mother tried her very best to stop it. She had me holed up in my room for a week as punishment. No school, no phone, no internet. Then they sprang on me we were moving, tomorrow. No amount of crying, shouting or begging helped. My mother had found a new hardness in herself. We drove off in one of those moving trucks, my father was driving and me in the middle. Noone said goodbye to me and I could not say goodbye to anyone either.
We moved over state borders, south into Texas into a small city. I got a new phone, that was monitored by my mother every second, a new laptop, which was also monitored permanently. My mother was fierce, intent to save her only daughter from making another mistake. The only problem was, she had no idea how technology had eroded her control on me before she even started to tighten her grip. The first thing at my new school was going into the library, logging into one of the old computers there and make a new email account. With that, it was easy to find out Lara's email adress. Reading her first reply made me sob silently in the school library. She had been putting all the blame on her and I had left her alone with that feeling for weeks before I could text her again.
But over time, our emails became less frequent. We had been only fifteen when I moved away. I was still holding onto the dream that we three would see each other at college. Then Anastasia was accepted at a french college with a famous acting programme. Her parents had greased the application a bit to get it through, as Lara had told me the story. And Lara was not going to college at all. Her grades were passable, but she had no way of paying for it.
Driving into this sad excuse for a town I felt more alone than I had ever in my life. With the help of my phone I navigated through town towards the college. It led me around a couple corners, past a couple gas stations, drug stores and fast food chains. Then it led me down one more corner and I was out of the town again. The street strayed into the forest again and I double checked if this was the right way - it was. I followed the winding street for about five more minutes upwards the hill until the trees finally parted and I got the first real view of the college. It being a private school before made total sense. It was build in an old british style, like a royal estate. With three high towers and long halls it blended into the surrounding surprisingly well. Around the buildings the garden was kept in immaculate condition. The hedges trimmed to the millimeter and the trees with perfect crowns. I parked my car on the car park in front, it was only half full.
I got out, grabbed my bag and my attendance confirmation and looked for the entrance. A couple of other people walked towards one of the bigger buildings, a long hall with a round, wooden door. The gravel crunched underneath my shoes. There were some students on the grass in small groups, reading, talking. The air was so fresh and crips for summer I felt cold in my t-shirt.
Luckily, I found a sign pointing me towards registration. There was a small queue of other freshmen. They all looked around nervous, their parents talking at them intently. What courses to go to, how to always call and when they would visit home again.
At the counter I put down my confirmation letter and all the other documents I had. The woman behind the table must have been close to retirement. She had snow white hair, done neatly up, and wore a wool blazer. She talked in a clear and strong voice that clashed so dramatically with her frail appearance I missed what she had said to me.
"Excuse me, could you repeat that?"
"Sure, dear. On this checklist is everything you need for your first week in Whisperridge. On the back is a little map, where all the buildings are. Do not be afraid to ask for help, everyone here is quite friendly and happy to help out. It is a small community up here."
I thanked her and walked outside to see where the dorms were. I turned the checklist around and looked at the map. It was quite detailed with lots of markers. The buildings were drawn in not as simple colored boxes but simplified versions of the real buildings. The dorm was on the backside of the compound. The main hall, where I just had been, was for administration and on the upper level was the libary. On the sides it was extended by more buildings with the class rooms. It all enclosed a spacious courtroom.
I went back to my car, to grab my suitcase to get my stuff into my dorm room. I had packed light, maybe a little too light. We had the middle of summer and it was already way colder than I had expected. Getting to the dorm made me eat my words. I was sweating before I even lay eyes on the building. On the map it looked a lot closer, in reality the dorms were even higher up the hill. The map had not prepared me for the elevation.
I had to catch my breath at the top, resting on my suitcase. I had a great view of the college complex underneath me. The courtyard in the middle of the main buildings had a walkway around on the edge and a big, old gnarly tree in the middle of it. The town of Whisperridge looked even smaller from up here middled between the expanse of trees.
"Quite breathtaking is it not?", someone said from behind me. I turned around and it was a man, the same age as my dad.
"It is .. something", I answered. He extended his hand and we shook after I understand that was what he wanted me to do.
"Name is Walter, Walter Rickson. I just dropped off my son. Are you a freshmen, too?"
"Yes, Sir."
"Well, if you see a Tyler Rickson, maybe say hi. He is a bit shy, you know?"
"For sure", I said and he said goodbye and wished me a great time. I grabbed my suitcase again and walked inside the dorm building. It had a creaky wood floor with lots of carpetting in the middle of the walkway. My checklist said, I was at the second floor. The stairway was just in front of me at the end of the hallway. A couple of other students walked past me and greeted me with a smile. I looked for an elevator but there was no sign of any. So I walked up the stairs hauling my suitcase up with me. My dorm room was already open when I came upon it. I came around the corner and saw someone already unpacking in the room. It was a small dark haired girl, she had her back to me and was frantically searching for something in her chaos of clothes. I knocked on the door to get her attention.
"Hi", I said.
She looked up surprised to see someone standing in the doorway, "Oh hi", she said adjusting her glasses. "You must be Livia, right?"
"Yes, that is me", I answered. "And you are", I looked back at my checklist but it did not say who my roommate was or that I even had one.
"Oh it is not on there. My name is Yuko. Nice to mee you."
"Nice to meet you, too. Did you already decide on which side you wanted?"
"Oh yeah, I put my stuff on this side if you do not mind?"
"No problem at all", I said and put my suitcase on the empty bed on the right. She turned back to going through the piles of clothes. I ignored her and unpacked my clothes, a couple of books and notebooks I put on the desk. I slid the suitcase underneath my bed. I turned around and Yuko was still going through her piles.
"You need any help there?", I asked her.
"It is just my contact lenses. I know I packed them but now I can not find them anymore." She looked honestly disappointed.
"Do you really need them? I can help you look for them."
She looked at me a bit strange, "No, no please. It is fine. My mother just said I look better without my glasses and I wanted to make a good impression on my first day. Does that not sound completely embarassing?"
I laughed, "Not one bit. But I really think you look very beautiful with your glasses on."
"Thanks, I might find them later then I guess." She began folding her clothes into neat piles.
"So, why did you decide to come here for college?", I asked her and lay down on the bed. It was quite hard and the springs squeeked with every movement. I looked up at the white ceiling with stucco on the sides.
"Whisperridge has one of the best history departments in the viscinity. And I wanted to stay close to where my parents live, so this works out quite nice. I want to become a teacher, you know."
"Close to your parents was probably your mother's idea", I said a little bored. After I got no answer for a couple of seconds I looked toward Yuko, her face was bright red. "Sorry, I did not mean to be so forward. It is just my mum would have loved for me to do exactly what you did."
"Oh, okay", she said and kept folding her clothes. We did not talk after that for quite some time. I looked through the ckecklist. There were lots of introductions and tours around campus. But everything started on monday, in two days. Until then there was nothing planned.
"Do you know what you want to pick as your major?", Yuko asked all of the sudden.
"No, not yet. I have not quite decided." Truth be told, I had barely thought about it at all. Seeing the amount of things Yuko had brought made it eerily clear, we had planned for different things. I barely brought more than for a weekend trip. I asked her if she needed something from the town but she declined. She wanted to get settled in and organize her stuff. I needed to get out.
I rushed out the door with only my car keys to get out as quickly as possible. When I turned the corner I ran straight into someone, "Oh I am so sorry", I apologized and tried to stabilize us both.
"No worries, nothing happened." I had bumped into a tall, slender blonde girl. She had a foreign accent I could not pinpoint, but it sounded scandinavian.
"Are you okay?", I asked again. She stood up straight again and smiled at me.
"Yes, are you? You must be new here right? I have not seen you in here before. I am Alval, second year now for me."
"I am Livia, and yes I just arrived." We made some more small talk. She was from some Scandinavian country I immediately forgot again and was studying abroad with a psychology major. She was also the only person who was unfaced by the weather here and was wearing a tank top and shorts.
"If you need anything, you can just knock over there", she pointed to a door on the opposite side of the hallway, "that is my room. Oh, I hope you come to the party tomorrow night. Best place to get to know everyone."
"For sure", I said and we said our goodbyes. I walked to my car and drove off down the winding road towards Whisperridge. I had no destination or goal so I drove around aimlessly. I needed to turn around multiple times because I reached the town borders. Even now there was not much to Whisperridge but the main road led out of the town towards a giant lake. Since Whisperridge was a bit higher up I saw down towards the sparkling blue lake. Lots of sailboats floated around, so small they looked like toys. The coast was lined with fancy looking houses, probably all summer vacation houses.
I got bored so I parked my car at the side of the main street and looked around. I found a book store and went inside. The shelved were neatly organzized and the store was completely empty except for me and a man behind the counter who had his nose deep inside a book. I walked around tables set up with books about fishing, hiking and other outdoors activities. 'Ten most difficult hiking trails' or 'Whisperridge: A Paradise for Hikers'.
Further in the back was a classics section I was more interested in. It was extensive, with works from german or french authors as well as all the english usuals. I browsed through the books, running my finger tips over the books. It was so quiet in here I heard my own breathing and everytime I opened up a book and turned the pages it felt like something illegal. Like I was disturbing a mandated peace. I grabbed three books I found interesting and headed to pay. Much I longer I was not able to handle the pressure of the silence inside the store. The cleark behind the counter, set down his book when he heard me and smiled one of the biggest smiles I had seen. His whole face lit up.
"Hello, how are you today?", he asked and totaled up the price on a small notepad.
"Oh, I am good, thank you. How are you?"
"Are you just passing through or are you staying here for longer for the trails?" He added up the prices by hand and without noticing I did the same in my head.
"I actually start my dregree here. I had just arrived."
"Oh that is marvelous. You picked a wonderful place to study. I might be a bit biased", he laughed on that last one and showed me the price. I payed in cash and he put it into a small metal box with a number lock.
"You know, I went to school here when it was just a boys boarding school. It changed quite a bit since then, but I just never left after I graduated. Must be over thirty years now", he laughed again. I smiled too. He was somewhat contagious. He put the books into a small plastic bag and slipped in a bookmark and some bonbons without asking.
"Here you go", he handed over the bag. "If you ever find yourself bored, you can always come in and look at the event board over there. Everything that is happening in Whisperridge is on that board."
I thanked him and looked at the board just beside the counter. It had lots of colored flyers about small concerts, theater plays, walking groups, hiking groups, book clubs, knitting clubs, sailing for beginners, sailing for amateurs. It even had a flyer for the party at campus Alva had told me about. But my eyes were caught by a small simple yellow notepad page. It had in handwritten letters "Help Wanted" and then an unmistaken drawing of the stores clerk. His smile popping off the page even in a simple pencil drawing. I grabbed the page.
"Are you still hiring?", I asked the man who was already deep inside his book again. He was reading the Iliad.
"But yes I am", he said and came up with a big smile from his book. "You see it is not much going on right now, but to keep everything neat and tidy and stocked can be quite some work. And I am not the youngest anymore, as you can see. Have you any experience working in a book store?"
My experience only included watching Lara shelf books while I was daydreaming. "No, I do not. But-"
"Do you like to read?", he interruped me which took me aback.
"Yes, very much so."
"That is the only important thing. I can pay you twelve bucks an hour. You should be working twenty hours a week or so. Sometimes I need someone to watch over the store, that would be great." He extended his hand and we shook on it.
"Just come by next week when you have some free time then we get set up", he said.
I thanked him and left the store with my bag full of books. In my car I checked my phone for any messages. I expected my parents to have called or texted but the had not. Which made me somehow more angry than if they had called repeatedly. I had left without much of a goodbye. My mum had given me the cold shoulder and so had I to her. It was fine by me I had nothing to say to her anyway. My dad had tried to give me some money but I had left it on the counter by the door before I had left. There was nothing that connected us together anymore. Nothing.</p>
