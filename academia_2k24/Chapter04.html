            <p>The organ blasted the second verse of 'Like a Shepard' and the whole church sang standing up and facing the altar in front. The pries, clad in mostly white, had his back to us and held up his arms up on either side. My mum on my left singing with such fervor today as if she wanted to shatter my ear drums. My father to her left, mouthed the words but was barely making any audible sounds. My head was ringing with every new chords, every new verse send shivers down my spine. Sweat was dripping down my back and I felt the little droplets run down in winding paths. It was not too hard to soothe my parents worries last night. They were waiting for me at the bus stop, my mother's brow furrowed deeply. They showered me in questions on why I had not called them earlier and what I was doing so late at that girl's home. But after I told them we were practicing our roles and that I was learning so much from Anastasia, who was the lead role this play, they relaxed noticably.
<br>"It is important to have people you can learn from that have gone through this already", my mother appeased herself and my father. "But you have to call us, if you stay out so late. You know we have church tomorrow morning. You will not miss it, no matter if you are tired."
<br>I conceded and told them I was really tired and wanted to go to bed. The walk back from the bus stop to our home was only a couple of minutes but after another couple of questions about what kind of girls I was hanging around with and if there were any boys present the conversation fizzled out and we got back in silence. I made sure to walk as straight as possible but I felt how every step seemed a bit off. I also did not mind the silence walking behind my parents. Somehow I was so calm and caught up in my own thoughts about the evening I did not feel it press unto me. I felt free and my fingers felt just a little numb. Lara had given me a couple of chewing gums to chew before I got off the bus. I had spat them out before getting off, my mum hated the sound of someone chewing on gum. It felt like nails on chalk board to her, she always said.
<br>The next day was far harder to conceal last nights events. I was completely parched, my eyes were sunken in and looking at the scrambled eggs for breakfast almost made me throw up. Luckily, my parents were busy with their own things that sunday. Dad was ranting about something at work. I wanted to follow their conversation but I simply could not. My brain was doing its own thing.
<br>We sat down again after the last chord was played and my headache subsided a tiny bit. The pressure pressing on my skull from the inside eased up. Every 'Amen' sent another wave through my skull, though.
<br>After the service finally ended I finally felt a faint feeling of hunger and the sweating had subsided. The pastor shook my parents hands on the way out at the door, "Thank you so much, it was a beautiful service again, father", my mum said. We got into the car to get some take away to eat at home. This was a pretty normal routine for us on sunday. I got my phone out to see if I had gotten any texts. Lara asked if I was alright and sent a picture of her feet covered up by a blancet in fron of the television. What would I give to spend my sundays like that.
<br>I asked her if I had embarassed myself last night, since I felt a bit fuzzy on the details. The wine definitely loosened me up and I was afraid I said something I might have better not have said. She affirmed everything was cool. Anastasia had apparently even texted her and told her she had fun as well, but I should keep that one to myself for now.
<br>And that was how the next weeks went by in a flash. The three met for coffee after drama club and on some evening we went to Anastasia to help her rehearse her scenes. Even though she had memorized her part flawlessly she was growing more erratic during the rehearsal, which meant we were drinking more often. The second and third time I was still a bit reserved and took smaller gulps from the bottle than the others but that changed quickly. I liked the feeling wine had on me. It made me feel warm and loose and that nagging voice inside of me became quieter with every sip. I also got better at hiding it from my parents. I always had gum with me for my breath but I also negotiated with my parents that I was allowed to stay out longer if I called before hand. And so it was easy to slip in late at night, wish my mum a good night and go to my room. The wine cellar of Anastasia's mother was inexhaustable. Every bottle we took was quickly replaced by another crate of french Bordeaux or an italian Merlot. Sometimes when we went down to grab a snack and Lara was sneaking into the cellar to grab a bottle for us, Anastasia's mum chatted with me. Always with a wine glass in her right hand (she preferred red, just like me I had found out) and make up done to perfection even at her own home. Her body was clad in designer clothes every time I had seen her, always ready to go to some event, gala or business event, what she and her husband often did. She was actually quite funny, reciting weird anecdotes from Anastasia's childhood. Whenever her mother talked Anastasia became very quiet and reserved, trying to look busy and making sure we were not wasting a second more of our time in the kitchen with her mum. Her mum often fixated on a small detail, like how sloppy her shirt looked or that she should take a different bowl for the chips so they would not spill over. "Anastasia", she would sharply shout without looking at her daughter, "please look at your posture, you are slumping your shoulders like the hunchback of notrdame."
<br>Anastasia took it without talking back but she ranted in her room afterwards about her mother for half an hour most days. That gave Lara and me more time to drink our spoils of the day and watch her pace up and down shouting about whatever it was that day. I learned quickly that making fun of their interactions was a line I was not allowed to cross, which was fine by me. Her dad barely said more than a greeting or a goodbye to us, even less than my dad which surprised me a lot. I thought that was impossible.
<br>One week before the spring play premiere everyone not only Anastasia was visibly stressed. Even Lara and me had quite a few costumes to finish up for the big day. We were working late every drama club meeting, Mr. Yates allowed us to stay late and the last one took the key to lock up. I had to let out one of the dresses because one of the girls who played a maid had gained a bit too much weight to fit into her costume. I had found an old sewing machine at the back of the prop room. Nobody knew it existed but I got it working fairly quickly so we could make more elaborate alteration a lot quicker. I only needed redo the hem on the pants and then I could finish up. Lara seemed very distracted today, she was checking her phone frequently but did not tell me how she was texting with. It annoyed me more than I wanted it to. So I poured my focus into the costumes but regularly stole a glance at her.
<br>Then, Arthur marched over to us, "Have any of you two heard of Anastasia today?" He had dark bags under his eyes and had thinned a little during the last weeks. "She has not shown up to practice today and I need to go over some of the scenes with her. She is not answering me."
<br>"She told me, she is not feeling well", Lara said. "I do not think she is coming in today."
<br>"She maybe could have told me so herself", he said furious. "She is not the only one under a lot of pressure. There are apparently some college scouts coming. Mr. Yates said so, he has some connections to a scout at Pen State. It needs to be perfect." He fumbled with his phone checking for a text from Anastasia. "Tell her, I want to talk with her", he said to Lara and left us.
<br>"What is wrong with her?", I asked Lara.
<br>"She just is not feeling well", said Lara but she could not meet my eyes. She had little bandaids around her finger tips. The sheer amount of sewing with a needle had scraped her skin and she had wrapped both index and middle fingers with bandaids. Two were beige but the other two were children's bandaids, with little adorable dinosaurs on them.
<br>So we worked in silence for a bit until Lara jumped up from her chair, throwing the costume aside and put her phone to her ear. She walked away quickly so I could not hear who she was talking to or what they were saying. After a couple of minutes, she came back with a concerned look on her face.
<br>"What is up?", I asked her standing up from my sewing machine.
<br>After a little pause she answered, "I have to go. Something came up. Can you lock up when you are finished?"
<br>"Lara, what is going on?", I had a weird knot in my stomach. Something was very different about her.
<br>"It got nothing to do with you, do not worry."
<br>"Oh shut up, of course I worry. I thought we were friends. Friends talk, you know." I knew it was a cheap shot making her feel guilty but I needed to know.
<br>She looked at me timidly, "Something happened with Anastasia. I have no idea what but I can guess. She just wants some company and not be alone right now."
<br>"Well, I can come with you over to hers."
<br>"No, she wants to get away from home, that is kind of the whole point."
<br>"I understand." We stood there in silence facing each other. This was something I was not invited too, something the two of them did only together. Even though Anastasia had made no secret out of it that she did not like me at the beginning we have been growing quite close over the last weeks. I had helped her almost every day after school with her acting. It felt like a hot knife getting stabbed in my chest. The thought of letting them hand out alone tonight and I went home alone made me feel uneasy.
<br>"Why do you not tell her to come over here? Noone is here, we are the last ones anyway. No parents, no teachers, just the three of us and we can finish up until she arrives?"
<br>Lara thought it over, "I ask her, but do not be hurt if she says no. It is not about you, she just is particular about these things." Lara got back on the phone, Anastasia picked up after one ring. I could not hear Anastasia but Lara told her about my plan of coming over and that I am here too. After a short pause Lara turned around and whispered, "Who is she gonna tell?" I guess she thought she was quiet enough but it hit me like another dagger right in my stomach. Who was I gonna tell? Maybe that was why I felt so hurt by them wanting to hang out without me.
<br>Lara hung up and turned towards me, "She is coming over. But I have to tell you a couple of things. Do not feel attacked by her mood, it has nothing to do with you at all. She just hates everyone and is embarassed by it. Also, just-", she searched for the right words but only found, "just keep your thoughts a little to yourself, alright?"
<br>"What does that mean?"
<br>"Well, sometimes you can be quite judgemental and it turns people off especially when they are vulnerable."
<br>"I am judgemental? Oh sorry I have opinions. Maybe you should write me some flash cards of all the words and thoughts I should avoid from now on."
<br>"See that is kind of what I mean. It was not meant as an attack, okay? But you have strong opnions on everything, which I like do not get me wrong, but sometimes it just is not the time for you to chime in on everything. Just keep it in mind, alright?"
<br>"Okay", I said and sat back down at my sewing machine. We worked in silence for half an hour. It was painful, my thoughts were turning in circles, always coming back to me being to judmental. Were other people thinking the same?
<br>Something landed just shy of my feet. I bent down to see if I had knocked something over. It was a small piece of white cloth. I picked it up and saw it had a heart shape sewn in with red thread. On the right upper corner it had a dinosaur bandaid swen on as well. I looked up and Lara was looking over at me. We were staring at each other, noone saying a word.
<br>Then the door opened with a loud thump. Lara jumped up, me too. I quickly stashed the cloth into my jeans pocket. I felt the heat rising to my face, somehow I felt like we were caught doing something wrong.
<br>"Anastasia?", Lara called into the darkness. Since we were working in one of the side rooms of the large gym hall with only a couple of small lights over head we could not see who had just come in. We were completely blind. Out of reflex I looked for something on the table I could use to defend myself. But there were only small needles for sewing, practically useless. Steps were coming closer towards us. I tried to make out who it was, with no avail.
<br>"What are you guys still doing here?", came the raspy and slurry voice of Anastasia. I could feel myself and Lara relax and we let out a synchronous breath out.
<br>"Damn, you scared me", said Lara walking over to her and hugging her.
<br>"Hey, Livia", she said to me and we hugged too. I smelled the alcohol on her immediately. After we let go I saw her eyes were red from cyring and she had a black eye. I wanted to start asking but she turned away quickly after seeing that I looked at it.
<br>"Can we go somewhere more comfortable? I brought some wine if you want any." She took out two bottles from her handbag, wrapped in a piece of cloth so they would not make any clinging sounds.
<br>"I have an idea", Lara said and lead us towards the stage. She helped Anastasia up who was visibly staggering the few steps there. We climbed up and Lara led us back behind the curtain and into the prop storage. There were lots of landscape props like painted trees and some clouds made from thin wood. We also had lots of furniture: tables, closets, wardrobes, chairs. But further in the back were couches and armchairs that some antique furniture store had donated to our school. They were used in lots of the plays set in old England, which were practically all the play when french fries was still the drama teacher.
<br>Lara jumped onto one of the couches with a loud thump that made the couch legs groan. Anastasia sat down beside her even less graceful. Luckily I had taken the two bottles of wine, I sat them down on the floor, pulled a little table towards the couch and set the bottles on top of it. It was not really a table but a small barrel. Good enough as a table. Because the two of them were sprawling out on the coach I decided to sit down on one of the armchairs next to Lara. It was uoholstered with purple velvet and had leather arm rests. It smelled of dust and felt a bit sticky.
<br>"Get me the corkscrew Anastasia", Lara said to her after she grabbed one of the bottles. Anastasia went through her handbag, "You know what-"
<br>"Come on", laughed Lara.
<br>"I really thought about it when I left. Do not forget the corkscrew. But apparently", she was stilling rumaging through her bad, "I did in fact forget to pack it."
<br>"How are we suppose to open it then?"
<br>"I thought we were going to your place anyway. I was in a rush alright. Do not argue with me."
<br>"Sorry, sorry", Lara said soothingly. "Livia, you have any idea how to open the bottles?"
<br>I tried to think about it, but I could not think of anything. "Not really."
<br>"Fuck", said Lara and we sat there silently.
<br>I looked over at Anastasia's face again and she clearly had a black eye developing on her left eye. She was also not wearing any make up which was the first time I had seen her like this. She looked so tired and pale. Seeing her without even a little bit of rogue on her cheeks looked plain wrong.
<br>"Before I forget", Lara started, "Arthur was here and he was very pissed you did not show up. You should text him something so he has no mental breakdown."
<br>"Yeah you are right", Anastasia said and pulled out her phone. We were far in the back so the overhead lights were barely reaching this far back. The phone screen gave her light and even ghostlier paleness.
<br>"What should I write?"
<br>"I do not know. Maybe something about bad headache?", Lara offered. "Or that you had your period and it was really bad. He will probably not press on it then."
<br>"Yeah, good idea."
<br>I watched the whole scene as if I were sitting in front of a television. It was like a bad sitcom and I was waiting until someone would finally talk about the obvious elephant in the room.
<br>"Did you finish all the costumes", Anastasia asked after she put down her phone again. Lara started to talk about what we have been doing and how everyone was doing during drama club. I felt my stomach grow tense and I was shifting nervously in my chair. The leather on the arm rests had stuck to my sweaty arm and made a loud noise when I adjusted its position.
<br>"Livia?" Lara and Anastasia looked at me. Apparently I had missed a question.
<br>"Sorry, what?"
<br>"I just asked if you finished Arthur's costume?"
<br>"Yeah sure. Just a little touch up maybe."
<br>Anastasia kept looking at her shoes and rocked them from left to right and back again.
<br>"What are we doing about the wine now? Do we have anything else stashed here?" asked Lara.
<br>"Oh you know what", Anastasia turned towards Lara and grabbed her by the arm. "Do you have any weed left in your locker? We could get it."
<br>"Shut up about that", Lara said angrily. She looked at me for a second but averted her eyes quickly. "I do have something left. But we have no way of getting into the main school building. The gym is not connected to it."
<br>"Oh I did not even know that", laughed Anastasia.
<br>"Fuck, this night sucks."
<br>"I know a way into the main building", I said. Both looked at me with confusion. "There is a roof top door, that can not be locked up because the lock is broken and it has never been fixed."
<br>"How would you know about this? Are you fooling us?" Anastasia said.
<br>"No, no. I was part of the physics club for like half a year and we once tried to make these eggs fly fall down from the roof and everyone tried to build something to protect it from shattering when it hit the ground. Well, that is how I know." After all this time my mum was right, all these clubs would help me in the future.
<br>"But how are we going to get on the roof?" Lara asked. She had sat up from her slouching position and was looking intently at me.
<br>"Finally I know something you do not. Come on." I jumped up without waiting for an answer, grabbed one of the wine bottles and marched towards the door. I heard the two girl follow me quickly.
<br>
<br>We snuck around the main building watching out for the night guard who was making his evening rounds with a flash light. There was no sign of him, but he could be anywhere. I lead the others towards the back of the main building.
<br>"There we go", I pointed towards a fire escape stairway that went all the way up to the roof.
<br>"You are full of surprises", said Anastasia. "I actually misjudged you so much at the beginning."
<br>"What did you think of me at the beginning?", I asked her.
<br>"That you were a loner nerd without any social skills. Then I thought you were just alone because you were mean to everyone. But it turns out you just had not found your people yet."
<br>"Until now", Lara added.
<br>"I have no idea if I should be happy with what you said, but I will take it."
<br>I climbed over the metal grid blocking our path up the fire escape stairs. The whole staircase squeacked and wobbled a little under my weight. The iron was cold on my hands. After I had climbed over I helped Lara over, her hands were so warm when I helped her over. Then Lara helped Anastasia over it, which took a bit more time. She was still very drunk.
<br>We climbed up the stairs towards the top of the main building, five stories. I still a warm spot where Lara had touched my hand when I came around the last bend and saw the roof before me. It was completely dark. I knew from my last time being here it was fitted with black roofing tarpaulin. The door inside cut through the darkness with its green and white emergency exit sign, that lit up the door in a tiny cone in this complete blackness.
<br>"I hope you were right about this", Anastasia said.
<br>I grabbed the door handle and it went down with a slight clicking sound, "After you, my majesty", I retorted.
<br>It led us into a dingy stairway at first only lit by another emergency exit sign. Further down we saw the normal staircase we walked every day. It was completely black after that.
<br>"Wait a second", Lara pulled out his phone and turned on the flashlight. She went in front and we followed all the way down to the bottom where the lockers were. We tried to be quiet but Anastasia was frequently bumping into me or missing a step. I had to catch her multiple times or she might have fallen right down. It was disorieneting to walk through the darkness with the small, bright light cone from Lara's phone which was mostly just blinding us instead of helping. Every story we stopped for a second and listened for the night guard, but there was nothing.
<br>"I have to go to the bathroom", said Anastasia on the ground floor.
<br>"Now?", exclaimed Lara. "Can you not hold it in?"
<br>"You do not need me to open your locker anyway, so what is the harm?"
<br>"Suit yourself, but be quiet." Lara and me walked on towards her locker. "Here hold this", she gave me her phone and I shone the flashlight on the numbers lock. 1-3-0-6. Was it her birthday, I wondered. The locker opened with a sharp metallic screech. We froze. I counted to five in my head, but nothing. No yelling, no flashlight cone. He must have made his rounds already or was simply dozing off somewhere.
<br>She rumaged through her stuff and I tried to hold the light so she could see something. Her locker was a complete mess. Loose paper was everywhere, the books were thrown in and I even saw lots of candy bar wrappers stuck in the back.
<br>Finally, she pulled out something wrapped in plastic. "Here we go", she said and packed it into her jacket pocket. She closed the locker door as silently as possible and we snuck over to the bathroom Anastasia was in. She was not finished yet so we waited.
<br>"Everything alright?" Lara asked me.
<br>"Yes, sure. Why would it not?"
<br>"Do you often break into the school at night?"
<br>"Do you?"
<br>"Touché."
<br>We stood there silently for a bit, I had shut off the flashlight from Lara's phone so noone would be able to see it. The only bit of light now was a tiny slit underneath the door to the bathroom.
<br>"I did not want to be mean to you before", she said suddenly. Her voice only a faint whisper. The empty halls gave it a spooky character.
<br>"What do you mean?"
<br>"You know. What Anastasia said about hwo she though you were kind of weird at the beginning. I never thought so. I just did not say anything because I thought you knew but maybe you do not. So, I am sorry if I made it sound like I thought like her."
<br>"Thanks", I said after a bit. It took me by surprise. I had never heard her speak like this to me. It made me feel uneasy, I was not used to this amount of honesty. "Is it too late to say I thought Anastasia was a stuck up bitch?"
<br>"Yes." It was Anastasia from inside the bathroom. Lara opened the door to the bathroom and we snuck in quickly so the light did not escape into the halls.
<br>"Are you fucking kidding me?", said Lara and I understood as soon as I stepped aside and saw what Anastasia was doing. She was in front of the mirror finishing up her lipstick. She had put on foundation and rogue as well as eyeliner and something for her lashes. The black eye was still painfully visible, maybe even more than before beside the perfect make up of the rest of her face.
<br>"Maybe I was not so wrong after all", I said smiling at her and crossing my arms.
<br>"Oh shut up you two. It is no crime to look good. I am just finishing up. Did you get the stuff?"
<br>"Yes, I did, but I am considering not giving you any."
<br>"Do not be so dramatic", Anastasia said. She packed the little, portable make-up studio back into her hand bag and we snuck back into the hallway with a couple of snarky comments along the way. We climbed the stairs back up to the roof and down the fire escape. We were back in the prop room behind the stage and sat down again. Lara and Anastasia on the couch and me on the arm chair.
<br>After I sat down I began to feel nervous. Lara and Anastasia joked again while Lara unwrapped the little package we had procured. First, it was wrapped in a small plastic bag with tape then another plastic bag with tape. Underneath was a sock, a children's sock with little princesses on it, very pink.
<br>"You put your weed in your childhood socks?" Anastasia laughed.
<br>"Why not? I think it looks cute", she answered.
<br>Inside the sock was a small metal container, an old chewing gum box. Lara unwrapped a little package that was inside and finally there was the weed.
<br>"Do you want to try any?" Anastasia asked me all of the sudden. I had been mesmerized by the complex wrapping and how methodical Lara's hands had moved.
<br>"How do you know I never did before?" I answered trying to look calm.
<br>"Do we have to play this game every time?" Anastasia yawned exaggeratingly.
<br>"Why do you have to be such a bitch all the time to me?" I said. I sat up a bit and I felt the heat rise to my head. I did not care.
<br>"I am not a bitch to you, I just say what I think. Do you want me to lie to you?"
<br>"So with you it is either lying or being rude? What kind of shit is that?"
<br>"Guys, come on", Lara tried but she was cut off quickly.
<br>"I am not rude, I just tell it how it is. You should try it sometimes. I just feel like you are so unauthentic all the time. At one moment you make some snarky comment or joke and the next you act like a helpless deer in headlights? If you can dish it out then you should be able to take it too."
<br>"And you think you are so perfect and honest? I have never met anyone so fake. Everyone needs to walk on egg shells around you."
<br>"On egg shells?" We were almost screaming by now and I had no idea where this was coming from. I felt my face burning, my ears as well. My hands were clammy and slid off the leather arm rests.
<br>"Why did Lara had to give me a long list of instructions on how to talk to you before almost every time we met up? Noone wants to be honest to you because you are so fragile everyone thinks you will explode if they do."
<br>"I did not ask her to do that", screamed Anastasia. Her cheeks now had a more natural red taint than before.
<br>"Alright, then why the fuck did you not come to drama club and show up with a black eye? And why are we not allowed to talk about at all? If this is what having friends is like I rather go back home where it is exactly the same." I felt tears forming in my eyes and my vision got a bit blurry but I was too caught up in the moment to feel embarassed. I was ready for her to throw it in my face, call me a cry baby or whatever but I had enough. Maybe this was the last time we three hung out together. The only thing that would suck, was I would not see Lara as often.
<br>I wiped the few tears from my eyes and when I looked up, I saw Lara with wide eyes and open mouth looking at me and then at Anastasia, who was also wiping some tears from her eyes.
<br>"It was my mum, alright", she said with a teary voice. "Sometimes when she gets really drunk she gets real mean. And when I do not say what she wants to hear, well, this happens. It was not the first time. Tomorrow she will go shopping with me or whatever to make me forget about it."
<br>"What about your dad?", I asked.
<br>"He never says anything. Acts like nothing happened. Spineless bastard."
<br>"Yeah, I know the type", I heard myself say. "Well, that was maybe a bit too harsh."
<br>"From what I have heard your mum is not a saint either", Lara interjected.
<br>"No, she definitely is not", I said, "but against yours she might as well be one. Man, that sucks."
<br>"Yeah, sucks", Anastasia said. We were quiet for a bit. Lara kept rolling her blunt and finished it by licking the almost see-through paper so it would stick together. She went over it twice before rolling the last part around holding it up in front of her and nodding.
<br>"I think you two need a little pick me up", she got a lighter from her jacket pocket. "And I need something to relax."
<br>"Come over, Livia", Anastasia said and tapped to her right in between Lara and her. "We can squeeze together." She got her handbag on the ground and tapped again. I stood up and moved over. As soon as a sat down I sank in a little into the couch. We were so close to each other our shoulders were touching. I smelled Lara's shampoo, a hint of lemon.
<br>The two tried to explain to me what to do but it all sounded like the most obvious thing in the world. Lara took the first drag and gave it over to me. She held in her breath and exhaled slowly. The smoke swirled up towards the ceiling. I held the blunt between my fingers and inhaled long and deep trying to hold it in. I coughed it up almost immediately. The others laughed and I passed it on to Anastasia. This went on for quite some time, it lasted longer than I had expected and I got better holding it in after just a few drags. Not even close to the others, especially not Lara, but it did not feel as embarassing as the first one.
<br>"So, what kind of mum stories do you have in store?", Anastasia asked me. "Anything close to my shit?"
<br>"Not close, but I have some good ones I think", I said and tried to inhale another drag. This time I held it in for two counts before coughing again. I felt a lot more relaxed, might have been the weed or it might have been the change in energy between Anastasia and me. Since I sank in deeper into the couch my right thigh and knee was touching Lara's and she had put her hand on her left thigh. Her pinky crossed the little ravine between our thighs and I felt her tip through my jeans. It was burning a whole in my pants and through my flesh right to the bone.<br></p>
