            <p>Monday was start of orientation week. It was finally something Yuko and me could do together. We got ready in our room, I packed something to write on and my water bottle. I did not know what else to pack, but Yuko was stuffing things in her backpack for so long I was feeling more and more out of place. I was expecting swaths of students running around towards the main hall like little ants trying to find their way back to the ant hill. But Whisperridge College was again smaller than expected. There were not thousands of first years like they would be at this time at Harvard or Standford but maybe close to a couple of hundred. The dean gave a speach in the main hall we all listened patiently from our chairs aligned neatly in a perfect pattern. He went on about the history of the college and how small classes meant better support from the staff for every student. More diverse classes and deeper understanding of the subjects. Whisperridge felt like the ivy leagues of ivy leagues if he was the judge.
<br>Yuko was busy taking everything down in her notebook. I wrote down the date of today but could not be bothered to write anything more down. After that we got a tour of the whole complex. Small classrooms, small library, small cafeteria. Everything look very tidy and neat. I was growing more and more bored and was looking for someone like me. But everyone looked so busy taking everything in like they would get lost in this sweeping maze the second they were left free to run around. <br></p>
