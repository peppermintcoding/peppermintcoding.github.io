            <p>I felt weirdly calm looking at him. Floating peacefully on the pool water in his navy blue suit. Even now he had this mix of trashy and sophisticated aura about him. His italian brown leather shoes were just a little too small for him. Something you would only notice after looking really closely. The geled back hair a bit too greasy looking. The beard trim a bit uneaven. Just everything was a bit off. His blood slowly colored the water rosé and he was floating towards the middle of the pool like a human inflatable matress.
<br>The air had a sharp smoke flavor. I normally do not get into these situations, though right there it felt so familiar. The only thing I could think about was the silence. Oh this silence that was not just the absence of something but filled your every cell more intensely than anything else ever could. It felt thicker than the water rippling around his body. It made me think of my mum. My parents and me at the dinner table. The only thing that was cutting through the silence then were the clinks and clanks of cutlery on porceline. My mother would stare intently at her pot roast and beans, neatly dividing them from the mashed potatoes. As if the only thing holding everything together was her making sure the beans were never touching the potatoes.
<br>My father would try his best to start a conversation without actually starting one by intensely clearing his throat or letting out a full breath. Even though this was not unusual for us, this evening was especially silent. A thick silence pressing me down into my chair, making every move of my fork feel like I am lifting something much heavier than a tiny piece of pot roast. Chewing felt like thunder in my head, banging against the insides of me.
<br>Then my father and me froze in our tracks. It felt like pieces of glass on my skin when I heard my mother break the silence with the quietest sob. Her shoulders showed the slightest movements, it was undeniable: my mother was crying. I felt the silence flow through my slightly parted lips into my throat. I had seen my mother cry often. So often even that it was not something that needed mentioning. She would cry on the phone when talking to my grandma. Or at the end of every cheap romance flick on television she watched almost every evening if something was on. It was so common and never any big deal. My father would joke about it, trying to wrestle the remote from her hands to change the channel. They would struggle for a bit until he gave up playfully and she would turn up the television even louder. Mouthing the words to most of the lines, since the only thing on these things these days were repeats.
<br>Sitting at the dinner table, paralyzed by the watery silence around us I knew this was different. My father knew it too. It was the first time I was the reason my mother was crying. Sure, she must have cried sometime before that because of me. At the first day of kindergarden, when she was waving goodbye through the window watching me cry and shout to get back. She must have cried even though I could not see it then. Without me knowing why I was turning towards my dad trying to make out what he was thinking.
<br>Standing at the pool I was doing the same. The same I had been doing a couple of years before at the dinner table with my family. I turned towards the only person I knew could not help me at all. My eyes trying to look at their faces unable to get high enough. Here at the pool the only thing I was able to focus on was the gun in her hand. Back at the table I was looking at the fork in my dads hand. The two scenes were so similiar but yet fundamentally different. This time it was not my fault. Nothing of this was my fault.
<br>My mother lay down her fork and knife so delicately it did not make any sound when hitting the table. Even now, without acknowledging anything, she dabbed her mouth with her white cotton serviette, kicked her chair back slowly and turned without a single word to leave. Finally I was able to free my gaze from the fork and follow her walking away from the table. I opened my mouth to say something but my tongue was thick and dry. My body was barely responding as it was.
<br>The clorine washed away the smoke quickly and my eyes wandered from the gun finally up to her face. The light from the pool lights gave her a ghostly taint but even the dingy lighting could not hide tears running down her cheeks. My tongue felt heavy and dry in my mouth. But this was different.
<br>I opened my mouth and called her name.<br></p>
