            <p>"Excuse me, Ma'am", I said loudly, "what book would you recommend for a complete beginner reader. Like someone you can read but rarely does?"
<br>A huge smile went over her face and her eyes had that little twinkle in them. She must have cut her bangs by herself since it looked a little too short and lopsided. "Well, madame if you like to follow me real quick." She lead me through two isles stacked with books to the very top. Lara was working after school in this small bookstore run by Elainore, who was just a little too lost in her own thoughts most of the time. It sort of fit for Lara to work here. The air was dusty and the towers of books made me feel like I was being getting a big hug. Some of the stacks looked like physics should not allowe them to stand upright but with some miracle they did. There were not many people in the store and the radio was playing over some old speakers making the bass disappear.
<br>"Here you go", Lara showed me towards the childrens corner. "You might like this one?" She handed me a book with the title 'Sarah makes her first friend at school'.
<br>"Very funny", I laughed. "Do you spend a lot of time in this section of the store?"
<br>"For whom is book for anyways?", she asked dodging my question.
<br>"I wanted to buy it for you", I said dryly. The book hit my shoulder with a soft thwack, I burst out laughing and she joined in immediately. It was two weeks before the big spring premiere of our play and everyone was biting their nails and walking around the school halls with big dark eye bags. Everyone but Lara and me, of course. Even for me the stress did not get to me. Normally, I would need to give it all to impress my mother with some sort of result but she seemed to very set on the next play where I would get a speaking role on stage. So this one did not really matter to her which lifted some invisible weight off my shoulders.
<br>"Will you come by Anastasias later?", Lara asked me putting back the books we had abused for our games. Anastasia was the lead actress of the play. The blonde one. "She is freaking out about her lines and is texting me repeatedly that she needs more practicing. I can not do another six hour session with her alone. Please save me." Her eyes were pleading for real even though she tried hard to overdo with the rest, her hands put together and her head bent down a little.
<br>"Will she be okay with me just coming over like that?", I said. I had not spoken to Anastasia much even though we were hanging out a lot lately. Well, Lara and her were hanging out and I was hanging out with Lara, but at the same time. I just had not much to say to her. She was sort of intimidating too. She would often comment on my clothes and ask backhanded questions about where I got them or if I was wearing them ironically.
<br>Lara had her phone out and was already texting Anastasia. She got a reply back in seconds and showed me the text. It said 'sure'. Good enough for Lara. "Oh it will be so much more fun now", she would repeat over and over again. "My shift ends in half an hour then we can get going. You will find something to do here, I suppose?" And with this she was off, 'Radiohead' playing in the background. Since my only focus was school and college applications I had never have to get a job. My parents gave me an allowance which I mostly saved since I was not going out much. I was looking through the classics section of the book store, which was rather small. Most of the books were targeted at middle ages women, new mothers probably. There were huge towers of books about what to eat before, during and after pregnancy. So, so many. I walked around a corner and found myself in the crime section. My favourite. I picked out a couple of books, read the excerpt and put them back. Through the tiny slits between the books I could see the register. Lara was talking with Elainore who was writing something down on a yellow sticky note. Lara tucked her hair behind her ears. She did that a lot when she needed to concentrate.
<br>I picked one of the books that sounded interesting (a crime novel about murder set in the time of the french revolution) and sat down in one of bean bags in the small reading corner of the shop. There were three bean bags around a tiny wooden table with towers of books encircling this nook. The bean bag smelled even more dusty than the rest of the store but it felt comfortable enough to read for half an hour.
<br>"You ready to go?", Lara's voice made me flinch. Time had flown by so quickly. Weirdly enough, I had only made it to page ten of the novel.
<br>"You finished up already?"
<br>"Yeah. And Anastasia called again, she had a little meltdown. Her coach quit. I wonder why."
<br>
<br>Anastasia's family was rich. That was the only thing going through my mind when we walked through the front gate of their house. It looked like a victorian mansion but in the suburbs. The gate was made from white stone with wrought iron fences. In the drive way were multiple cars, none looked familiar. My dad was driving and old Honda and my mum a Toyota. That was the extent of my car brand knowledge but these just looked expensive even to a novice. Anastasia was standing in the doorway in a silky bath robe. "What took you so long?", she exclaimed both angry and desperate. Their front door was made from deep black wood and was almost twice the height of her. She looked comically fragile standing in the doorway. Lara tried to calm her down, console her that everything was going to be alright. I had asked her mutliple times why she was friends with someone like Anastasia. Not that she was a horrible person, but the two did not fit at all. It always came back to them being friends during grade school, actually best friends. They walked together to school everyday, ate lunch on the playground and defended each other from the boys. But then with the years they grew more and more apart. Different hobbies, different friend groups. The thing that kept them in touch was drama club, which Lara more of less only joined because Anastasia begged her a couple of years back during the golden age of the club. Not that I had noticed any of that. Apparently Mr. Yates had only recently taken over the drama club and not everyone was all too happy with it. Anastasia called the plays uninspired and soap opera trash. She idolized the last teacher who had reigned during the golden age, Mr. Armand. Since I had never seen any of the plays before or had Mr. Armand in any of my classes (he taught french, obviously) I only experienced him second hand through Lara and then again through Anastasia. Somehow it felt like they were talking about two different people all together. I surely liked Lara's description a lot more. She called french fries, which was simply endearing. She also told me that french fries adored Anastasia which was the reason or part of the reason she liked him so much. Anastasia always got the lead role, even though they were open castings everyone knew that the french guy would pick his muse every time. She got extra training sessions with him after everyone already left. He tried to mold her into a star, or so Lara put it.
<br>From Anastasia only came praise about his genius, his ability to get the best out of you. He was also a fan of public humiliation. Like a shark he sniffed out a tiny flaw in the first ten minutes of meeting him and he used it whenever he was in a mood. Lara told me, the first year she had joined she was still trying to get a speaking role on stage. She actually told me this story late at night when we were walking to the bus stop, just the two of us, after we met with the others in the park. The moon was shining vaguely through the thin clouds and our shadows danced with the street lamps. Growing larger and darker until they started fading out again by the next lamp. I was wearing my new shoes I made my mum buy me because everyone was making fun of my old ones.
<br>"So, please do not laugh about this", she said and I assured her I would not. "I know right now it sounds a bit ridiculous but back then.." She trailed off and we walked side by side in silence for one, two street lamps.
<br>"I wanted a part on stage with Anastasia. She always went on and on about how great french fries was about teaching her how to act. She had been given her first lead role, as a sixth grade, almost enough for a scandal in drama world. So I tried to get a small role, nothing with too much screen time. And so he gave me the part of a service maid, it was some victorian play like always, you know? He was obsessed with the victorian times of England. The only french guy in the world who loved England more than his own country I guess."
<br>"I must have somehow provoked him, I really have no clue. I probably was too loud during one of his signature monologues about the theatrical arts." She took another deep breath. Another street lamp fading out our stretched shadows. "He had this look everytime he singled someone out to torture and this time I felt his eyes burn holes into me whenever I tried to practice my lines. Out of nowhere he threw his hands up in the air and was shouting 'No, no no no'. Everyone stopped and looked at me. He had this tendency to talk himself into a psychedelic state where he would get more erradic with every sentence. It was getting weirder and weirder, talking about my inability to make the words come alive, how this was about to ruin this years play and all that. I tried to talk myself out of it but I was too scared and intimidated back then. So", another big breath, "he said I needed to ease up. I was too up tight. Me? Can you imagine?" I could not.
<br>"So we were trying out these weird excercises like laughing histerically or shouting something into the silence around us. Everyone had stopped what they were doing and were watching this train wreck. Everytime he just shook his head and looked more and more devastated which made me even more insecure. So he wanted to try one last thing. He came back with a sheet of paper from his briefcase and gave it to me. I started reading it and I noticed at the middle of the page it said 'Joleene kisses Oliver passionately'. I froze completely. The only thing I registered who he called to play the other part: Sergej." Even I knew who Sergej was. Everyone knew he was at least two years older than anyone else in our grade but officially he was our age. But it was undeniable looking at him. He dominated on the football team and was easily keeping up with the seniors when he was only in middle school. The coaches pulled some strings to get him on the team. He also was a total asshole to everyone. He was big, most of the time angry and violent. When he was walking through the halls, the lights dimmed around him (this might be an exaggeration). When he made the team a lot of the cheerleaders and other girls were making their moves on him until everyone notices he just was not only a brute on the field.
<br>"Well, I tried to weasel myself out of it. Said I did not want to do it, the whole show. French fries did not let be back out. He said, if I did not try this scene I was forfeiting my role and he would give it to someone else. And besides, he knew what was best for me and my development so I should simply listen and do what he wanted. Even Anastasia gave me an encouraging nod. That bitch. She would have never done it, or he would have never put me in that position."
<br>We walked a bit side by side in silence. I thought about what to say but I could not think of anything supportive. So I asked her what happened next. There was a lot of back and forth but in the end they acted out the scene and she kissed him. "And it was my first kiss, that fucker", Lara shouted into the night.
<br>"That must have felt horrible", I said.
<br>"It was. His lips were dry and he smelled like the mouth of a pig. It was disgusting. Sorry if I sound so dramatic about it. I just always dreamt my first kiss would have been different."
<br>"Yeah, I get that", I said timidly looking at my feet. Now the only thing I could think about if I had to kiss someone weird during the next play and waste my first kiss like that.
<br>Anastasia's shrill voice yanked me back to reality, she was almost hysterical. Her acting coach quitting had driven her into a state of emergency. Sadly, Lara and me were the troops next in line to serve. We walked through the entrance hall which was decorated with a huge glass chandelier hanging from the ceiling reflecting the light on the white marble stairs. There were not many pictures or plants, everything was very monochrome. Anastasia's father waved to us from the couch facing the gigantic television playing saturdays's football game. I could not see him, only his lazily waving right hand draped with a golden watch.
<br>Her room was even more cliché than the rest of the house: princess bed with a big metal bed frame reaching for the ceiling with white and pink curtains guarding her majesty during the most important hours of her day. It also was huge. There were multiple doors, one opening into a bathroom and one of the others into a closet only filled with her shoes. Lara immediately jumped onto one of the bean bag chairs in one corner of the room in front of a big circular window with book shelfs around it. Even the books had been indivually put into white and pink sleeves so the real covers would not shine through. To me this was worse than a war crime, hiding them from the world. I wanted to free them this instance but the only thing I could do was stand around awkwardly with my big eyes scanning everything.
<br>"Livia, sit down where ever you want", Anastasia said absently to me. She was going through a big swathe of papers thrown all over the floor, looking for something specific. "Here it is! I need to practice this scene more. I can not get it right. And this stupid guy quit on me out of nowhere."
<br>"Out of nowhere?", Lara asked. She was not even looking at her but staring right at the ceiling. Her body sprawling over the bean bag.
<br>"Yes, he just quit", Anastasia repeated.
<br>Lara dropped her head to one side to look at Anastasia. She was grinning at her, "Spill it what happened? Or I will not help you one bit with the scene."
<br>Anastasia looked away for a second, "It is not my fault okay. I am under a lot of pressure and everyone thinks this comes easy. Well I tell you what: it is not. It is hard work and he did not understand that people under pressure sometimes say things they do not mean. That is all I am gonna say. He was unreasonable. Actually, he was not even that good. He kept on making me do weird breathing excercises and what not to calm me down. I do not need to calm down, I need to nail this role."
<br>Lara and I locked eyes knowingly. "Yes, you seem completely calm, no doubt about it right?", Lara said.
<br>"Totally", I retorted and finally sat down on one of the other bean bag chairs. The little beans in them moulded to my body shape and let me sink very deep. They smelled slightly of vanilla and something I could not place. Something sharp.
<br>Anastasia pushed some crumbled papers into Lara's hands and paced up and down opposite from us like a lion behind bars. She had her hair up in a high ponytail and looked even now very well put together. Her eyeliner looked flawless and she had a little bit of lip gloss on her.
<br>"Alright, you will read Arthur's part and put at least some effort in. I need to play off you a little bit." The two started acting out one of the final scenes of the play. I still had only a slight idea of what the play was about, I had not read it in full up to then. Arthur had cheated on Anastasia with another woman and she was supposed to be furious but had at the same time conceal her own adultery until later when the whole thing blew up. It looked ridiculous with Lara lounging in the bean bag chair with her short hair dangling almost to the ground, looking more like a stretched out star fish than a person. And Anastasia in her pink bath robe pacing up and down trying to convey as much anger as she possibly could muster. It all seemed very much exxaggerated, soulless to me. She yelled and gestured wildly with her arms but I never felt one bit threatened by her.
<br>"Okay, okay", Anastasia exclaimed breaking character, "this is not working. I can not do this with you hanging around like a bum. Come on stand up and give me some fire and fury."
<br>Lara looked at her but actually got up and faced her with fingers clutching the loose papers.
<br>Nobody said a word. They simply looked at each other. The air became stale, palpalpabel. "Please Lara, I need your help", Anastasia pleaded. I did not get what was happening.
<br>"Ugh, alright. Alright, I will try better. But you owe me for this one!" Anastasia nodded and they began again, from the top as they say. The words shot from left to right never hitting their target just right. Lara was trying her hardest to play the traitorous husband, still doing his best to conceal the truth. She was cold and distant but Anastasia was just shouting the words at her. When my mother was angry at my father she would never do anything like this. She would make the house turn against him. Make the walls cave in and strangle him right where he stood, make the windows grow bars and turn the air into an icy desert. She did not need to yell to make her point.
<br>When they got to the end of the scene Lara said, "That was good, was it not? What do you think Livia?"
<br>The spotlight turned their hot shine on me and I froze like a deer in headlights. "She did not even listen, she does not care at all I can see it in her eyes", Anastasia said and turned around to take a sip of water. Her skin had turned to a light reddish hue which made her skin look even more flawless.
<br>"Shut up", Lara scolded her. "What do you think? Just be honest." I saw pleading in Lara's eyes. She probably wanted me to just support her and say how great I thought they looked so we could get this over with. But I could not do it. How could I lie looking at those eyes.
<br>"For me, there was just something missing", I said.
<br>"Oh, please be a little more vague, could you?", Anastasia said. She had her hands on her hips and looked at me with annoyance.
<br>"No, what I mean you can keep shouting all you want and throw things at her - erm - him, but it just does not look very believable to me. I just do not buy her acting this way, especially since she has proof of him cheating and just wants him to say it. She feels superior to him. You, you just sound like an angry child." Silence. I had said too much. Anastasia lips parted for a second but she closed them again. I looked at Lara, she looked more suprised than mad.
<br>"Alright, give me the text for a second", I marched over to Anastasia and she handed them to me with some reluctance. I acted out the beginning of the scene with Lara. I tried to keep my voice down, talk detached and lure her into me with every word. I knew I could deal the final blow anytime, but I waited. I savored the seconds. Every word from her mouth I knew were mere lies and I would be the one to expose them one by one. I felt the role taking over my gestures and body languages. My hands were controlled, my eyes lazily walked around the room but whenever I met Lara's they were piercing into her.
<br>"Why did you stop?", I asked Lara when she just stared at me mid line. She needed a second to adjust to see it was me speaking and not her fake wife. "That was actually kinda scary", she laughed. "Who thought you of all people could slip into that role just like that". On that last word she snapped her fingers. Anastasia was just looking at me with her arms crossed at her chest.
<br>"It was kind of-", Anastasia began, "good, I guess."
<br>"You will not get any higher praise from her than that. I have never gotten a 'good' before." Lara laughed and sat down on the bean bag again, sprawling her arms and legs to all four sides. Her top was riding up just a tiny bit to expose her belly button. "Here", she handed me her script, meaning she held up the script into the air for me to come and grab it, "from now on you two work this out."
<br>Anastasia gave me a soft smile and I took the script and we started the scene again. I try to give her pointers whenever I thought something was not quite right and she started listening quickly. She sadly was so stiff in her ways it was hard to change her view of the character and make her play the role more like I had imagined.
<br>"This is sooooo boring", Lara muffled at the ceiling. "And Anastasia why do you sound like you have a stick up your ass?"
<br>"Shut up, I do not!"
<br>"Yes, you do! You need to relax more and I need know just what you need."
<br>"Lara! No!" But Lara already jumped up like a nimble cat. One moment she was a sprawling starfish and after one blink she was on her feet sneaking towards the door.
<br>"What is she doing?", I asked but Anastasia only shook her head. "Can we do that middle part one more time. I just can not get it right." She acted like nothing had happened.
<br>We practiced that part a couple of times, without much change. Then Lara burst into the room carrying two bottles in each hand. "No worries, nobody saw me. Your dad is still watching the game and your mum had just opened her own bottle. I was like a ninja." With that she made some weird moves she probably believed ninjas would do but it looked more like a kid during their first lesson of jui-jutsu. Lara planted down the bottles on the floor and sat down crosslegged.
<br>"Shit", she exclaimed.
<br>"Ugh, again?", Anastasia was walking towards one of her dressers and went through some of her clothes to conjure up a corkscrew with a golden handle. The handle was a sculpted fist that grabbed onto the screw.
<br>"You like white or red, Livia", Lara asked me while she grabbed the corkscrew and went to work on the first bottle.
<br>I felt the heat rising through my body, my ears started burning, "I- I do not want any actually. I have to go to church with my parents early tomorrow."
<br>Lara stopped shoving the corkscrew into the bottle and looked at me with big eyes. Then she looked at Anastasia and they burst out laughing. At first I wanted to join in out of habit but they were wailing and some tears were running down Lara's eyes. After a small eternity I had to just sit there I was getting angry, "What?", I said a little too loud.
<br>"I am so sorry", Lara tried to surpress her laughs that had turned into little giggles, "it is just.."
<br>"We did not peg you for a church girl", Anastasia finished her sentence.
<br>"Right. Nothing wrong with that, it is just one more surprising thing about you."
<br>"Great", I answered.
<br>"Oh come on", Lara tried. "They drink wine in chruch, do they not? Why not drink a little with us, it helps Anastasia relax and me to not fall asleep bored." She started working on the cork again.
<br>"I am not allowed to drink the wine during communion. My mum says I am not old enough yet." Saying it out loud made me look even more like a loser. My cheeks started burning now too. I wanted to leave immediately.
<br>"Do not be such a-", Anastasia began but Lara stopped her with a venemous look.
<br>"Here are your options", Lara said and stood up to pull out the cork with one satisfying and loud blop. I had the feeling the door would crash open any second and one of Anastasia's parents bursting in to ground all of us. Nothing of that happened. "You could watch us pass the bottle around and suffer through another scene with her sober", she took a long gulp directly from the bottle. A little of the red wine was still on her lips when she put down the bottle. "Or get a taste of this delicious", she checked the label, "Merlot." She looked at me proudly and stretched out her arm with the bottle. Her lips were still a little red from the wine and she licked over them but the color still stuck. It gave her a very intense look in the beginning twilight.
<br>My arms moved on their own accord and I took a big sip from the bottle not breaking eye contact with Lara's lips. The wine tasted like grape juice that had gone bad. It had a terrible after taste and it made me sweat even more now. I gave the bottle to Anastasia without looking at her. My eyes were fixed on something else.<br></p>
