            <p>I put on some lipstick and threw on my jeans. "Are you sure, you do not want to come with?", I asked Yuko.
<br>"Yeah, I am not much of a party person. But you have fun."
<br>We had not talked much since we had become roomates. Alva told me yesterday I only had a roommate for the first year. It was to help everbody to find friends and what not. So far, I got a special needs case.
<br>"Alright. How do I look?" I twirled around but Yuko gave me nothing more than a 'good'. The party was in the basement of the dorm building. It had started at ten but I was only now, over an hour later, making my way downstairs. I expected it to be a couple of dozen people hanging around, playing some games and maybe drinking some beer. But I was ill prepared for what Whisperridge College had to offer. The basement was already packed and people crowded at the sides of the stairs on the way down. The smoke in the air bite my lungs and dimmed the light even further. There were so many people it was hard to know how big the room was. From one end came loud rock music but was muffled from all the people. I got the feeling to be incredibly out of place and started to envy Yuko's decision. At least she was honest with herself, she did not belong here. But neither did I.
<br>People were pushing from behind so I was pushed further inside until I hit the bar, or at least that what it resemled. A couple of tables pushed together with a couple of kegs of beer and all sort of other alcohol. I scanned for some wine to get me going and found some cheap bottle and filled a plastic cup.
<br>"Livia", someone shouted but it was impossible to know who or from where. But then I saw Alva in the crowd frantically waving at me. She stood over most of the others and her striking blonde her almost glowed in the dingy light and smoke.
<br>"Hi", I shouted back over the music.
<br>"It is so nice that you made it. Here let me introduce some people to you." She introduced a whole lot of people standing around us, some shook my hands others just nodded or raised their cups a little. "I am so happy you are my new neighbour. We need some new cool people in our hall. It has been getting boring."
<br>"And you think I will change that?"
<br>"I feel it, yes. And my feeling about people is never wrong." She laughed. I became incredibly aware of all the guys drooling over her. Without doing anything she was commanding everyone's attention. Everybody wanted to be near her. She was magnetic, her shorts glued everybody's eyes on them. Then I noticed we were the only two girls. All her friends were guys. No wonder she was so excited for me moving in. It was not about me in particular, not at all.
<br>"I have a surprise for you", she whispered in my ear. She came very close and grabbed from her front pocket a little plastic packet with pills. Little white pills. "Have you ever tried some?"
<br>"What are they?", I asked.
<br>"Happy pills", she laughed and opened the packet to get two out. "Here, I show you." She put on her tongue, winked at me and swallowed it down with a big gulp from her beer. She immediately shouted 'woooh' with both arms raised.
<br>She held the other one between her fingers and wanted me to open my mouth. I had no idea what it was she was about to give me but I did not really care. If Alva took it, it could not be too bad. I opened my mouth and she put it on.
<br>"Swallow quickly", she shouted and I flushed it down quickly with my wine. It tasted atrocious. But it made Alva even more happy and she got my hand to lead me further into the room, where people were dancing.
<br>I was not big on dancing in front of everybody but the crowd was so tight it was not really a dance floor but a blob of people and the wine started to work its magic. We danced and the sweat was dripping from my arms, legs and forehead. Alva enjoyed herself and repeatedly grabbed my arms and hips to dance with me. At first it was a bit much, her hands on me so much but after a while it started to feel really good. We started to dance closer and closer together. Every touch felt so intimate and everyone around started to melt into one. The next moment I was not only dancing with Alva but someone else behind me and then with someone else again. My cup had been empty for a long time and I became incredibly thirsty but I did not want to stop dancing. I always gravitated back to Alva, her blonde hair a beacon of light in this rough sea of faceless blobs of people. My hair stuck to my forehead and sides and sweat was dripping from my nose tip. I had no idea what kind of music was even playing anymore but I loved everything.
<br>Then Alva made a drinking motion to me with a imaginary cup and I nodded forcefully. She grabbed me by my hand and we tried to pass through the swath of bodies to find something to drink. I felt so parched my tongue was like a big sponge in my mouth. Alva grabbed two cups from somewhere and led me further towards the stairs, up and filled the cups in the bathroom at the top of the stairs. Going up the stairs I started to feel how wasted I really was. Without her helping me I would have fallen down the steps multiple times. But I could only laugh about it. She pressed one of the filled cups into my hand and we toasted. The water was so cold it hurt going down but I drank it like a dying dog in a desert. It made Alva laugh even harder at me, so she got us another round.
<br>"Come on, let us go out for a second", she said and I followed her like a lap dog. I would not have found the way out of here myself. Before I though the hallways were straight and clear but now it felt like a labyrinth only Alva knew by heart. When we stumbled out of the door she already had two cigarettes in her hands and was asking someone next to us for a lighter. She gave me one.
<br>"I do not smoke, you can have it", I said to her and offered it back to her.
<br>"You sure?", she asked again. "It calms me down a bit, it might help you too." I would have done anything she said at this point. She was the most knowledgable person I knew, the secrets of the world lay open for my blonde angel and I was simply a sheep following. The smoke made me cough after the first drag. But she was right, everything was spinning less and I was coming back down bit by bit.
<br>"That was so much", Alva said repeatedly. "And I think you turned some heads tonight." She nudged my shoulder with hers. I looked up and the night sky had so many stars it felt impossible to count them.
<br>"What do you mean?", I asked and took another drag. More coughing. They tasted like shit, but I kept going.
<br>She smiled mischievous and nodded towards someone behind me. A boy walked towards us, staggering with every second step. He smiled at us, or at me I was not sure.
<br>"Hey, do you have one more for me?", he asked Alva. She gave him a cigarette and lit it. I had no idea where she had all these things. The pockets on her pants were so small and tight it was a miracle she even got her fingers in there.
<br>"You are new here, right?", he asked me and blew out a cloud of smoke. He had his hair geled back slick and was wearing a white polo shirt. I just nodded. "I am Tyler by the way, nice to meet you."
<br>"Livia, nice to meet you too", I got out and Alva laughed again.
<br>"Inside it looked like you too knew each other very well. And now look at you two." My face began to burn. What had we been doing at the party? "Hey, I need to take care of something. Find me later, Livia?" She gave me no chance to answer and staggered off towards the dorm again. She turned heads.
<br>"You two have been knowing each other long?", Tyler asked me. He was obviously trying to chat me up.
<br>"No, just met her yesterday. We are sort of neighbours in the dorm. Where is your dorm room?"
<br>"Oh, I do not go to school here. I just come here for the parties." He laughed shyly. "My parents come here for summer vacation, we have a house at the lake. And since it is mostly full of elderly people with dinner parties I come here whenever there is a party."
<br>"I was not aware I was in presence of royalty from one of the castles at the lake." It was weird how the words fell out of my mouth. My tongue was still spongy and I took another sip from my water.
<br>"Is that why you threw herself at me down there? You were looking for gold?"
<br>"I might not exactly remember every detail from tonight but I am sure I was not the one who was throwing anything at you."
<br>He blew a puff of smoke into the air. "Maybe I just wish you had", he laughed and his teeth almost shone in the moon light.
<br>"My mother would love this", I said. I threw my cigarette on the ground and extinguished it under my shoes.
<br>"I doubt your mum would have loved to see you dance tonight."
<br>"No, surely not. But she would love you."
<br>"I like her, you should listen to her more. Not the best luck with your exes?"
<br>"She never was a fan, no", I said grimly. I was feeling completely drained all of the sudden. Everything felt heavy and the energy to dance all night had washed away as quickly as it has come to me. "It was nice to meet you but I do not feel so good. I need to go to bed."
<br>I walked past him but he grabbed me by my hand and pulled me back. We were just inches apart and then he kissed me softly on the lips. I let him. There was no tingling in my body, if anything it made me feel more exhausted and numb. We parted and he said something about he had to do it before I left but I was already struggling to find my way back to my room.
<br>I stumbled up the stairs and used the walls to get me to my room. I got in, quietly shut the door because Yuko was apparently sleeping already. I had no idea how late it was but it was probably something around midnight. I pulled down my pants, got out my shirt and went straight to bed.<br></p>
