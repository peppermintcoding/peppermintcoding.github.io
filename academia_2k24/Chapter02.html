<br>### part one
<br>
<br>
<br>Getting into a good college was all that mattered in life to my parents. A good college meant one of the big four, nothing else could even be called a college to them. And so for me I began early to apply to every extra curriculum I could. I ran twenty miles every week for track and field in 8th grade even though I hated running. After every training I had to empty out my shoes trying to build little sand castles with what came out of them. Since puberty started a little later than for the other girls I was falling behind quickly. While running our intervals I was watching the blonde pony tails of Nicole and Susanne sway left to right and back again while I was trying to keep up. It was not meant to be. And so I was moving on like a wandering trader not trying to sell my wares but find something valuable enough to put on my growing resume.
<br>Chess club, math olypiad, swimming, the choire. I tried it all fueled by my parents enthusiasm.
<br>While all the other kids found their clique easily through the years in middle school I was moving around so often I always felt like a tourist. My mum asked me every day how it was going in the chess club or with my math team, trying to ascertain if this was the one thing that would guarantee me a ticket to Yale. Or Stanford. It never was enough though. And I never cared enough to get mad.
<br>It did change when I joined the drama club. My mum found out that Dartmouth (one of the four colleges that mattered) had a rather prestigious drama program with available scholarship openings. Not that my parents were in dire need of financial aid to get me through the four years of higher education. It was simply about getting to tell other people how their daughter was getting it.
<br>Drama club was different, very different to my other resume endeavours: I actually liked it. I started it in my first year of high school when I exhausted all the physical clubs and was trying out more of the intellectual offers my school had. Since chess turned out way more boring than my mother made it sound. After just one afternoon sitting in that dimly lit classroom 302 with seven nervous looking boys staring at their wooden figurines I was ready to quit. The first and only time I attended their club meeting I was forced to sit through an epic battle of the two best players. While the two sat there in silence watching over the board the others tried to explain the rules to me. The air felt ripe and the silence between condescending explanations pushed my shoulders so far down I felt them cramp up. The two players obviously wanted to impress me with their strategies, so enthralled by their own genius they did not notice that I had no idea who was actually winning this silly little game. This was getting people into colleges? I was understanding of track and field or field hockey. I got why colleges looked for math olympiad winners. But watching a chess match felt more like an ancient torture method than anything else. It did not help that the others were leaning a little too close to me when trying to explain some weird knew rule that was only now getting important. Or why this move the dark haired boy played was called "the red herring" and why it was actually funny. When the mouth breather came close to my ear to explain the history of that move I smelled sloppy joe with a side of french fries and a hint of nervous sweat. Before the weight of the silence between these fascinating anecdotes or the shuffling of butts was about to break every bone in my body I was saved by the bell. I jumped up so quickly and made up an excuse about my mum having to pick me up exactly right now to escape this torture chamber.
<br>That evening my father was working late and my mum was reading some brochures in front of the television. I was reciting the words in my head I had practiced the bus ride home on how to convince my mum to drop out of chess club.
<br>"Livia, there you are", she said with her eyes still glued to the shiny little paper in her hand. The back was a deep moss green, so definitely something from Dartmouth. I had memorized all insignias, colors and writing styles of the ivy league colleges by now. I was ready to lay it on her, get it over with quickly while she was a little distracted but in a good mood. Daydreaming about my college future always gave my mum a certain glow around her eyes.
<br>She started reading me a paragraph from the pamphlet, like she was reciting from an ancient greek scroll. She was holding it with stretched out arms, narrowing her eyes. "Are you listening, Livia. This is important!". It did not matter how much enthusiasm I showed towards any of this, it did not come close to my mother's and so it was simply not enough. Dartmouth had an extensive new drama program. They even build a new theater stage, an extension to one of the lecture halls.
<br>"But then again, what would you do with a degree in drama", she added.
<br>I grabbed the tiny moment between her thoughts. "Well, I surely would not need to major in drama if I got in through the scholarship. I would only be expected to be a part of it during orientation, would I not?". Desperation was seeping through every word that rolled from my lips. I knew nothing about acting, nor did I want to. Everything was better than watching someone move their figurine every couple of minutes a single square ahead and nodding knowingly.
<br>My mum looked up from her pamphlet towards me with an unusual expression on her face. The words just tumbled over each other, something I had not seen from my mother ever. Me showing an interest in something like this had ignited something inside of her. Before I knew it, she had enrolled me in the drama club and called off the chess club. It would stretch my attention to thing, she would say repeatedly at the dinner table to my also overly happy father. Suddenly I was "thinking seriously about my future" and "not swimming against the current anymore". I had never felt any of that since I had gone to all the clubs my parents wanted me to. But who was I to tell them any different since I was saved from another afternoon in that dingy classroom 302.
<br>The drama club met every tuesday and thursday after classes. Since my school was rather small the big stage was part of our gym. The gym was one big hall where multiple classes were having PE together. It could be segmented into three smaller parts with cloth dividers rolling down from the fifteen meter high ceiling. When playing soccer the ball made a very satisfying plonk sound when it hit the dividers. On the long end of the gym, the wall opened up with a little stage tucked in there. I had never seen the drama club practice since I never was in the gym after hours, so when I walked in through the big front doors it felt like a different culture. It must have been similiar to when Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas. The first thing I noticed was how loud everything and everyone was. On the stage some students were painting props for the background while a portable radio blasted some rock song I could not make out. It was echoing through the hall, especially with none of the dividers pulled down. So everybody who wanted to say something needed to shout it, and so they did. A couple of students at the side where shouting sentences at each other while holding sheets of paper in front of them. Ocassionally the punching sound of an electrical screwdriver ebbed through the hall. Everyone, and I mean everyone looked so busy. Something that had never happened in any of the other clubs. During track and field I would try to hide from the teacher to maybe miss one of the long jump rotiation or in math club we often just ranted about anything other than math. Here, noone even noticed I had walked in and was watching the scene unfold for more than a minute by now. I located the tallest person, which must be the teacher Mister Yates, and walked over to him with my application paper slip in hand.
<br>He was running his hands through a movable clothing rack looing at all the different outfits and shouting something to a girl next to him. She was taking notes on a wooden clipboard, or maybe she was just doodling something I could not tell. She was tall, maybe half a head taller than me, with sort black hair. Her roots were showing dirty blonde underneath and they were cut in a short bob.
<br>"Mr. Yates?", I asked. He kept talking with the girl about that outfit "needing more red".
<br>"Oh hi", he finally answered after my third attempt fighting against the clamour. "You must be our new member then. It is so nice to meet you." We shook hands and I awkwardly handed him the forms I had with me, which he simply folded in half and put into his back jeans pocket.
<br>"We are already deep into this years' spring play preparations, so I am afraid there are no more speaking parts for you at this time."
<br>"Oh, I am not really sure if I would fit on stage."
<br>"I hear that from almost all the newcomers", he laughed. "Do not worry, it will come naturally with time or if it does not come then that is fine as well. But-", he trailed off looking around in the gym, scanning for something. The girl with the clipboard made eye contact with me and gave me an apologetic smile. "What about costumes? Lara could need some help, I am sure, with the costumes, are you not?"
<br>"There is always something more to do", she answered.
<br>My eyes darted from him to her and back again, "I really do not know the first thing about costumes I am afraid."
<br>"Have you ever sewn on a button that ripped off?", Lara asked me twirling the pencil in her hand around her finders.
<br>"I have-".
<br>"Then you will do just fine", she added quickly without letting me have a second to elaborate.
<br>"Perfect", Mr. Yates said, "then I will see how the progress is with our star crossed lovers over there." He hung one of the costumes he was holding back onto the hanger and walked away leaving me alone with Lara.
<br>"Alright, you can help me finish up the dress for Nicole, she is playing the main role so this dress is center piece to the whole play." Luckily for me, Lara was a talker. She did not need much input from me and would go off into long tangents about this and that while we were trying to make the costume look a little more victorian. Since I had no idea what the play was about I tried my best to give my opinion about the length of the hemn or the color of the buttons. Needless to say, I had no idea what I was saying or doing but Lara did not mind at all. We were sitting on the floor at the side with the dress between us. She had the neck on her lap and was frantically trying to sow on some white lace to make the dress look more expensive than it was. At the moment it looked more like a Frankenstein dress, built up piece by piece from other costumes. While Lara was quick with her words and had way more experience with what needed to be done she struggled with the implementation greatly. It was almost comical how clumsy she felt all of the sudden, the needle and thread looked uneasy between her fingers. I was working on some of the buttons that needed to be sewn on again, since they had fallen off during the last fitting. Most likely Lara had sewn them on.
<br>"So how come you joined the drama club so late in the year without even a desire to play on stage?"
<br>"Guess I just did not want to step on anyones toes, but truth be told", I paused for a second and looked up at her, "I crave the applause of the crowd."
<br>"Oh, I could tell the second you walked over to us. You have this certain flamboyance and natural confidence when speaking to strangers. It is quite a sight to behold, actually." I grabbed another of the buttons, cheap plastic ones with so many glued on glass diamonds it made them look even cheaper (my mother would not approve) and threw them at her, hitting her right at the forehead. We both burst out laughing.
<br>Time flew by joking around with Lara. Turned out she joined the drama club, similiar to me, with no ambition on actually performing on stage. She had applied because it was one of the first clubs alphabetically and chess was no option for her. Which is all she had to say to get me in the door and finally I could provide something to her almost monologue.
<br>"How did you make it look so neat?", she asked honestly surprised looking at the buttons I had sewn on. They were nothing special, but my mother had insisted for me to learn sewing since it was something she had picked up from her mother.
<br>"It is actually easier than it looks if you have any patience at all", I answered, which got me showered in a handful of zippers, the only thing throwable that was in her reach.
<br>"Alright everybody", the voice of Mr. Yates thundered over all the shouting, music and hammering. Funnily enough, it all stopped almost immediately. "That is it for today. Thank you everybody for your help. I see you all next tuesday, have a great weekend!" He started clapping and everyone joined in so I starting clapping as well. Lara noticing my bewildered face shrugged and clapped just a bit louder until everyone stopped and packed their bags to go home. I grabbed my backpack and waved goodbye to Lara and made my way out the doors to catch the next bus. I was already thinking about how I had to spin all this so my mother would be okay with me not having any part on stage. Dartmouth would not accept me just because I had sewn on some buttons for the main role. But maybe I could convince my mother it will all change with the next play in fall.
<br>Someone called my name and I turned around to see Lara run after me, her backpack swaying wildly behind her and her hair bouncing up and down with every step looking ridiculous. "Livia", she said gasping for air, "do you need to get home right away?"
<br>The question took me by suprise. "Do you need me to stay longer for the costumes?", I asked surprised.
<br>"No, no. Me and some of the others often go for coffee afterwards sometimes. I wanted to ask if you would like to come with? You could get to know some of the others, but believe me it is downhill after me." I struggled to answer with anything at all and all I could say was that I had to ask my mum if I could stay little longer. My mother was just as surprised as me at the phone, since I had never asked her to stay longer after school. But she agreed as long as I did come home before seven to eat dinner together. I hung up, walked over to Lara and four other drama kids, telling them I would come with. They quickly introduced themselves but with every new name I forgot the last one and at the end I was glad I had not forgot Lara's.
<br>I did remember two of the four others: they were the two lead roles. A brown haired boy, probably a grade higher than me, with long arms and expensive looking shoes. His co-lead was a blonde girl with a pony tail who liked to talk about her acting coach who would come by their house once a week to work with her on the script. The other two, a girl with braids who spoke just a little too slow for me not to be annoyed and her shy friend barely spoke a word. She probably was unable to actually listen just like me since it was hard to remember what she had said at the beginning of her sentence when she finally finished. So it was either us listening to the power couple talk about their vital roles in the spring play and what they did to make it extra special this year or me and Lara joking around about something.
<br>
<br>"And then Lara let me try her coffee and it had some kind of syrup in it, it tasted like strawberry with chocolate, it was so sweet."
<br>"Do we know Lara?", my dad asked grabbing more of the potatoe salad.
<br>"No, dad. I just met her today during drama class. Are you even listening?"
<br>"Do not speak to your father like that", my mum intervened. "He has been working very hard these last weeks and is exhausting from the long hours. What I just do not understand is why you can not get a part on stage? What is the point of it then?"
<br>"Mum, the spring play is in four weeks. There are no more roles left over. But Mr. Yates said he likes my commitment and is already considering me for the fall play." I had to give her something and this lie was so close to the truth it did not matter. I just had come back from coffee with the others and was still a little giddy. It might have been the caffeine since I was not allowed to drink it at home. But I could not stop talking about what had happening tonight in excruciating detail. My dad looked more tired than ever, he might actually enjoy the silent dinners more than my mum and me. But I was unstoppable. Even my mum was waving the white flag after a few questions of hers were answered to her satisfaction. Yes, I was still invested in the drama club. Yes, I will try to get the lead role next play. Yes, Mr. Yates seemed very capable. No, you do not need to talk to him during office hours.
<br>After rinsing my plate and saying good night to my mum and dad I went up to my room and checked my phone. Lara had not wrote me, but we exchanged numbers already and I was dying to write her something. I had this burning desire to keep the conversation going with her and not let it slip through my fingers as always. It just felt a lot simpler with her than it had before for me. In the end I decided to text her I had fun tonight and I was looking for our book 'Sewing for children three and up'.
<br>After switching off my light and pulling up my covers I had to check my phone again: 'good, finally something heavier for me to throw at you'.<br></p>
