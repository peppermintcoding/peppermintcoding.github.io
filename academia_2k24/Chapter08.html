            <p>I woke up from loud chatter. I tried to open my eyes but I was blinded by the light. My head was exploding and I felt like I would throw up any minute. I blinked and looked around. I was still in my room, I had no idea were those voices came from. Yuko was sitting on her bed and reading. I tried to saw good morning but my voice did not listen to what I wanted. I croaked something at her. She looked up and frowned at me then continued reading. I looked around and saw the window was open wide. The chatter came from outside.
<br>I got up a little bit and checked my phone, it was ten in the morning. My headache intensified, it was throbbing at the sides. I also was sweating like crazy still and had been the whole night looking at my bed sheets.
<br>Since Yuko was more interested in her book I got up to get me some water. I put on my shirt and pants from yesterday. There was a communial kitchen for every hallway with a tap, two small plates for cooking and a microwave. I grabbed one of my empty plastic bottles from the drive here and stumbled to the door and to the little kitchen area. Noone was there for which I was extremely happy. I was not ready for any small talk. I filled my bottle half way from the tap and downed the whole thing before filling it again to the brim. The water helped in fighting down the nausea but my head was still throbbing like it was about to explode. In my exuberance I had not thought to bring any pain killers.
<br>I walked back to my room and came across Alva's door. I tried my luck and knocked on her door. Hopefully I was not interrupting her sleep, but she swung the door open so quickly I stumbled back and almost fell down.
<br>"Oh, hi", she smiled at me and came towards me for a long hug. "Was yesterday not so much fun?"
<br>"It was", I got out. "You look a lot more refreshed than me though."
<br>"Yeah", she looked me up and down and wrinkled her nose. "You might want to get out of those clothes and take a long shower."
<br>"I will but I wanted to ask if you had any pain killers. My head is killing me."
<br>"Sure", she turned around and went back into her room. I followed her slowly. The walls of her walls were papered with posters of bands and everywhere were piles of clothes. She was at her desk fondling with one of the drawers at the side. "Can you close the door please", she said and waited for me to do so before she opened the drawer and got out a heavy book. She opened it and it was hollowed out with lots of different plastic bags inside. Kind of cliché.
<br>"Those are great against a headache. I took one myself this morning. You can have one", she held it in her hand towards me. I wanted to grabbed it but she pulled it back and closed the book, "But first I want some details. What did you and Tyler do after I left you alone? You two did not come back to the party." She smiled mischievous and sat down cross legged on her bed. I was desperate for the relief of some pill, my headache was not letting off.
<br>"Not much happened. We talked for a bit and I wanted to go to bed. So I went. He kissed me once before I got away. That is it. Please can I have the pill, my head is really killing me." She gave me the pill and some water from a glass next to her bed. I downed the pill immediately.
<br>"So, how was the kiss?" She tapped on the bed at her side for me to sit down. I did.
<br>"There really is nothing to tell. He just kissed me. I barely remember anything."
<br>She frowned, "I was hoping for a bit more. You two were really getting it on before you know. You got some veeery jealous looks from the other girls."
<br>"Jealous looks because of me and Tyler?" I was baffled.
<br>"He is very popular, you know. A lot of the girls try to throw themselves at him every time. He is quite rich, and I mean, incredbly hot."
<br>"He is?"
<br>"Oh come on. Are you blind or something?" Alva continued blabbering on but it was hard for me to follow anything. She told me some story about another party but I was unable to understand anything. "So yeah, good for you." She laughed.
<br>"Sure. He just is not the .. type I normally go for", I said trying to keep it vague.
<br>"Maybe you should. Is college not about having new experiences and all that? It is definitely why I came here to the states. You should give him a chance."
<br>"Maybe you should get with him then."
<br>"Not my type actually", she laughed.
<br>"So you like them poor and ugly then?", I joked.
<br>She playfully threw me back and I landed on her bed, "Shut up", she said and I got back up. Thanked her for the pill and got back to my room. She shouted, "Open your mind", to me before I closed her door again.
<br>Yuko was still reading her book and I got my stuff together to take a shower. My bathrobe and wash bag and got to the showers. I looked over to Yuko once and saw she had been looking at me but averted her eyes quickly back to her book. I was not ready to get into it today though.
<br>The showers were at the end of the hallway. Hot steam was already in the air when I got in. Some other girls were talking in front of the mirror but I made my way to one fo the showers. While undressing I finally smelled it myself, I reaked of sweat and booze and smoke. My hair were a complete mess. I took a very long shower, tried to clean everything twice. While the hot water filled my body with life again some memories of last night came back to me in flashes. I remembered how I had danced in the basement with Alva and the with Tyler as well. I remembered the kiss with him. Was it a good kiss or a bad one? I could not have answered Alva that question. It just made me feel nothing in particular.
<br>I turned the water off and put on my bathrobe to walk back to my room. On the way back a group of guys came towards me, smiled at me knowingly but did not say anything. I closed the door behind me and took a deep breath.
<br>"I hope I did not wake you when I came back last night", I said to Yuko who was still in the same position reading. She said no without looking up. I let it be and cleaned up my dirty clothes and drank more water.
<br>"Do you want to get some food for lunch?", I asked her trying again.
<br>"I actually have something for lunch already, thanks." There was no getting through to her. It made me feel uncomfortable. The pill had started to work and my headache had subsided while I was under shower. I sat down on my bed and looked towards the open window trying to ignore Yuko. Which was impossible. She was like a little thorn in the side of my eye. Even though the fresh air from outside came through the window I began to sweat again. The walls were so close and the room so small all of the sudden. I yearned to be anywhere else. I needed to get out. I got dressed, a little awkwardly because I did not want Yuko to see me naked so I got on my underwear while still wearing my bathrobe and then throw on a shirt with a hoody over top and some jeans. I grabbed my car keys and put them into my bag to leave and went for the door without another word.
<br>I bumped into Tyler who was standing in the doorway ready to knock when I opened it.
<br>"Hey", he said and lowered his fist slowly.
<br>"Are you stalking me already? They normally do this after a couple of dates at the earliest."
<br>"I always have been an overachiever", he said and smiled wildly at me. He was wearing a quarter zip in burgundy red and some navy kaki pants. The official uniform of any boat club everywhere.
<br>"What are you really doing here? How did you know this is my room anyway?"
<br>"Actually, Alva told me where your room is. I texted her before. I wanted to ask if you want to grab some lunch together? I guess you need one as much as me", he laughed.
<br>"Look", I began and took a deep breath, "last night was fun. It really was, but I do not want you to get the wrong idea. I can not see this going anywhere."
<br>"Not even to lunch? I had not planned much more I am afraid. I am really hangover. Probably will go for a nap afterwards, I will get you back here before you know it."
<br>I weighed my options. And then I saw Alva standing in her doorway watching us. She winked at me and went back into her room.
<br>"Why not", I said and closed the door behind you. "But I am driving. I do not want to be stranded with you somewhere."
<br>"You might reconsider this", he laughed.
<br>He had a white carbiolet with leather seats. Without even another word he opened the door for me and I got in. The confidence impressed me.
<br>"You are used to getting what you want", I said to him when I sat down in the driver seat.
<br>"Mostly, yes", he started the engine. "You are here, are you not?" He smiled at me and we drove off the car park down towards Whisperridge.
<br>
<br>I expected him to take me to his yacht club, I was sure he was a member in, but he did not. We drove out of Whisperridge towards the lake and drove along it for quite some time. He made small talk with me about the lake and I listened with half an ear, sometimes asking a question here and there. He did not mind, he was happy to talk for both of us. Then he slowed down and parked at the side of the road. We got out and he led me down a gravel path towards the water front. Down here at the lake it was much warmer than up at my dorm. The wind sweeping over the mirror like surface sent little ripples across it and blew up little bits of sand. We walked towards a little food truck, 'Dana's Delights' was written in bold letters on all sides. There were a couple of tables to stand at with a parasol here and there. Barely anyone was here to eat, just two guys who looked like they had a long night as well.
<br>"It is the end of the season, that is why there is not much action right now. But during the height of summer it is always buzzing."
<br>He greeted Dana by name and they exchanged pleasantries. He ordered chicken tacos and nachos with cheese, which sounded just perfect, so I got the same for me. We also got two large lemonades, which looked fresh and self made with ice cubes swimming on top of the plastic cup. My stomach was growling by now and I was more feeling sick from hunger than from the hangover. We got to one of the standing desks and waited for Dana to bring us the food over.
<br>"So that means you will be gone soon, too?", I asked and added quickly, "Because the season is ending."
<br>"Yeah, pretty much", he leaned on one arm and looked out over the empty beach. "My mum likes to stay longer than most folks around here. She does not mind the cold as much. But my stepfather is so looking forward to getting back to the city."
<br>I took a sip from my lemonade from my straw, it stung from the cold, "I get that feeling. Not that I have a city to get back to, but now that I am here I do not know if I should have gone somewhere else."
<br>"But then you would have been robbed of the chance to meet me", he smiled and so did I. "But really, it is gorgeous here. If you get used to the cold in winter it even is wonderful in winter. I was only here once during winter. The wind is ripping you apart if you walk along here but everything is covered in powdery snow and everything gets so quiet. So peaceful."
<br>"Again, not the biggest fan of the quiet. You are so far zero for two. Hate the cold, hate the quiet."
<br>"Tough cookie", he grinned. "Alright, you can go hiking for years here and would never hike the same trail twice."
<br>"Hate hiking", I laughed.
<br>"Sail on one of the best spots for sailing in the country."
<br>"Never been on a boat to be honest, but I do not get what the fuzz is all about."
<br>He furrowed his eyebrows and leaned on both arms, crossing them on the table. His eyes were shaded by his Yankees cap and it was the first time I saw a necklace peeking out underneath the polo shirt. "Fishing?"
<br>"My dad never took me, but again, kind of silent hobby, is it not?"
<br>"Yeah see that was a rookie mistake by me. I am just getting to know you, so I think you can forgive me that one."
<br>"Are we?", I asked slowly, "Getting to know each other?"
<br>"What else would you call this then?"
<br>"A free lunch, I am a poor college student." I laughed, he did too.
<br>"That is kind of embarassing now. Because I only pay on dates for both meals, but you made it very clear this is not a date, so.."
<br>"You slippery weasel", I tried to splash some lemonade on him with my straw. But it backfired and one drop landed in my eye, which was quite painful. But it just made us laugh harder.
<br>Dana brought the food over just in time for me not to starve to death, it looked and smelled delicious. "Be careful of that one", she said giving me a nod and she turned around and got back to her truck.
<br>"So, you bring all your girl here then?", I said and dug into one of my tacos with a satisfying crunch. My mouth was flooded with all the flavors and I had some avocado running down the side of my mouth. It was just what I had needed today. I was too busy enjoying the food that I did not even hear what Tyler had said about it. And we both did not care enough to stop shoving the food into our mouths. He looked almost as famished as I did.
<br>I gave half of the nachos to him, which he took and inhaled as well. I was so full I had trouble staying upright. This was a terrible concept for a restaurant, great food that made you stuff yourself and then nowhere to sit down. As if he could read my mind he asked if we wanted to sit on the deck chairs still on the beach. I agreed and he got up without saying another word and payed for us. He came back and winked at me, "It is a date now."
<br>We sat down next to each other on two chairs and lay back. The sun was peaking out from the clouds and it was warm enough in my hoody.
<br>"Why did you come to Whisperridge then?", he asked me but kept his eyes on the still lake water.
<br>I thought about it for a second, "I really do not know actually."
<br>"Oh come on, noone in the world goes like: no idea where to go to college, yeah Whisperridge it is. You would have needed to look this place up."
<br>"Why do you not go to college here?", I asked with the hope of changing the subject.
<br>"My mother would never have let me. It is not a bad college here, do not get me wrong. It is just not the right.. caliber."
<br>"What about your stepdad, can he not advocate for you with your mum?"
<br>"I barely know the guy. They have just married last summer after dating for a year or so. I have no clue what my mum sees in him, especially since he is also not the same.. caliber as we are used to."
<br>"Are regular people not fancy enough for your elite circle then?" I asked playfully angry.
<br>"No, no. Not at all. That is not it. It just, he just, he just does not fit at all. Not with my mum, not with the people my mum convenes. Livia, I am not saying he is not good enough to be in the same circles as my mum and me, believe me." He got heated and even got up from his chair to look over to me.
<br>"Calm down, I was just kidding around. You forget this is going nowhere and I do care little if I am good enough for your circle."
<br>We were quiet. I felt bad. "I am sorry, I did not want to insinuate anything."
<br>"Yes you did and you could at least try to not laugh it off."
<br>"Are you actually angry with me now? I have just made a joke, Tyler."
<br>"Why does everyone love to make that joke then? There is always some truth in it. Everybody thinks they have it so hard and I so easy. They know nothing and are the ones who judge."
<br>We were silent again. He had sat back down and we were watching the clouds go by slowly with the wind.
<br>"I came here to be as far away from my mum as possible. I have looked at quite a few colleges but Whisperridge was the furthest by actual miles that was any good."
<br>"Fuck." It was all he said for a while. After that he asked if he should take me back to the dorm and I said yes. We drove off in his cabriolet, the wind fighting with my hair for dominance. He parked right in front of the dorm entrance but I did not feel like getting up.
<br>"I am sorry Tyler for before. I hope you have a good semester." I did not know what else to say and got up.
<br>"I would love to see you again, next summer", he said.
<br>"Yeah, me too." We smiled and I waved awkwardly. He drove off and I watched him all the way until he finally disappeared behind the hedges and trees. I did not expect me to actually mean it, but I was looking forward to seeing him again.<br></p>
