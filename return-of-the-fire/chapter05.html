            <p>Chapter 4
<br>
<br>
<br>The night was agonizingly long for Malina. She saw the moons wander from one side
<br>to the other, trying to keep her head from replaying conversations and memories. She
<br>didn't know if she slept at all, but she felt her whole body ache and her mind mushy.
<br>Her back hurt the most, it felt stiff. She never ever had slept not in a feather bed. This
<br>was unacceptable. The conversation with Dago repeating in her head over and over.
<br>She came to a conclusion, chatting with the moons shining throught he thick canopy.
<br>The rain hadn't stop the whole night but their tarp was holding firm. Dago had been
<br>sleeping next to her the whole night, snoring quietly.
<br>Her father was a good and honest man, Malina was sure of it. She knew him better
<br>than anybody else. Especially better than Dago. So why would she believe in a shady
<br>man, someone like Dago, who was in the business of dreamshrooms. A nagging
<br>feeling still left in the back of her head, trying to get free, but Malina did her best to
<br>surpress it completely. She was her father's precious pearl and he was honest, good,
<br>hard working man. He was everything she had left, her mother being gone and their
<br>family in shambles. Dago was just making fun of her, trying to make her afraid. What
<br>a good chuckling he must have had after that conversation.
<br>Malina didn't dare to get out of her clothes at all, normally she slept in a nightgown
<br>with a warm blanket or two to snuggle with. But here she only had a thin wool
<br>blanket over her day clothes. It wasn't freezing cold here as she thought it would be,
<br>but it was cold at night. A lot colder than down in Nigita.
<br>The men were huddling around a small fire, feeding on the remaining dry firewood
<br>they had. A faint mist of rainddrops flooting through the air making it feel moist all
<br>around. For breakfast they had simple bread with some old and hard cheese and ham.
<br>Not something she would normally eat in the morning, but she was starving. The
<br>foraging yesterday left her hungry, very hungry. The food filled her empty stomach
<br>and warmed her from the inside. The cold of the night slowly leaving her body. The
<br>men eyeing her weirdly, but saying nothing.
<br>"Slept well, Missy", Dago asked. Was that a grin on his face? He was joking with her.
<br>He must be. The other man stared grumpy at her, their beards full of breadcrumbs.
<br>The forest silent all around them. Malina felt like she was watched again, looking
<br>around between bites.
<br>"We will walk some way west, find some more juicy shrooms and then head back to
<br>Nigita. I want some more bags full before we leave here."
<br>They packed up their things, Malina the only one without a backpack, and started
<br>walking through the woods again. The air moist, the ground soft with moss and grass.
<br>They had to climb over fallen trees or get around big thorny bushes. Malina made
<br>sure not to get scratched through her clothes, but she wasn't successful doing it. Her
<br>arms and face bore several scratches. She hoped they wouldn't leave a visible mark
<br>on her face. Birds singing in the distance.
<br>A shrill whisteling cut through the background noise. Dago froze in front of her, the
<br>other men too. They drew their knifes, longer ones than the ones to cut shrooms with.
<br>The shining metal reflecting the little light there was in these woods. So much iron,
<br>how could they pay for these? The small swords must have cost a fortune.
<br>Her questioning was cut short when arrows hit the three men, knocking them to the
<br>ground with cries of pain. Malina wanting to shout herself but the sounds were stuck
<br>somewhere down her throat. She fell down to her knees, hands to her chest and
<br>praying to the Enlightening. Dago kept standing in front of her, hands in his pockets
<br>watching the woods around him. From every side men, and to Malina's surprise,
<br>women, with bows came from the shadows, down from trees and closed a circle
<br>around Dago and Malina.
<br>The savages found them, they were surrounded. How could this happen? Dago had
<br>made sure of it, they were not too far into the forest. Not near of any territory. Father,
<br>Malina thought. Why did you make me go?
<br>Naked female necks. It was the first thing Malina noticed. About half of the savages
<br>leading  Dago  and  herself through  the  forest  on  hidden  paths,  were  woman.  All
<br>wearing nothing around their necks. A little less, but still outragious, were their naked
<br>breasts. The left breast poked through a hole in the clothing. Decorated with colorful
<br>patterns and rings going through the skin. Malina was baffled. How could these
<br>people live like this? Did they not have any sense of shame?
<br>"Let me do the talking", Dago whispered to her. "I know my way around these
<br>people. Well sort of."
<br>"You met them before", Malina hissed. "How could you lead us so close into their
<br>territory? Are you mad?"
<br>"Stop this angry act of yours. It doens't help anyone, Missy. I didn't lead us into their
<br>territory. The forest so close to the border belongs to noone. Or so I heard anyway.
<br>Something must be going on here. They never venture so close to the edge."
<br>"It seems somehow you were mistaken. I can't understand how that might have
<br>happened. You seemed so wise, Master Dago." Malina was terrified by the men
<br>around her. She counted five men and four women. The men were muscular in stature
<br>with shoulder long hair mostly. Some of them seemed to be twice as wide as her
<br>father. She always though he was strong.
<br>The forest cleared before them and Malina was guided towards what could only be
<br>their village. But in this case they were no houses of clay, stone or wood with
<br>shingled roofs. They were building their houese betweent the trees with a big clearing
<br>in the midde in which the group arrives. Here the rain poured down from above. The
<br>buildings were small and connected with little bridges made from single branches. It
<br>looked like suicide walking over these to Malina. Closer to the trees there were
<br>seating areas carved from fallen trees. Fires burning all around with people preparing
<br>food.
<br>"Follow me", a man with blue color around his eyes and long black hair said. He was
<br>a good arm length taller tham Malina. He showed them towards one of the seating
<br>areas, covered by a giant leaf roof. A man with a ring made of iron through his nose
<br>sat there waiting for them. He had broad shoulders, keen blue eyes and long ebony
<br>hair.
<br>"Dago", he exclaimed his arms showing them to their seats opposite to him. "Did we
<br>not have an agreement. I thought I was clear about it."
<br>"Karman, it is good to see you in good health again", Dago said, without any fear in
<br>his voice. Malina trying to keep tears from rolling down her eyes. She knew the
<br>stories of what could happen to young woman in these woods. "I think you are
<br>making  my  little  friend  here  quite  uncomfortable.  Could  you  please  assure  her
<br>nothing will happen to her?"
<br>Karman looked at Malina. These eyes were like clear blue water on a sunny day. "No
<br>doubt you know our reputation, but reputation and mouth of word does not mean
<br>truth. Truth is important. We do not take what is not ours, not with or without force.
<br>We do not kill those you come unarmed and without the desire to hurt. Your friends
<br>broke one of these rules, we spoke to your friend here years ago. But even so, your
<br>men were drawing weapons when they should not have. Why is that?"
<br>Malina still fighting back tears. His words didn't make much sense in her head. The
<br>fear eating away at her, making her understand words but not their meaning.
<br>"See,  nothing  will  happen  so  stop  doing  that  face  like  you  will  meet  the
<br>Enlightening." Dago waited for a reaction from Malina, but she kept on staring at
<br>these blue eyes. "Anway, I didn't know they had weapons on them. You allowed small
<br>knives to be carried for cutting the shrooms and that is all I had provided to them."
<br>"I see", Karman said. "What is with your companion?"
<br>"Ah, I think she is thinking about killing her father. After all what happened I sure
<br>would think about it."
<br>Killing her father? Was that some kind of plan of his? Feeding her lies of her father
<br>and than turning her against him?
<br>"Why would I want to hurt my father? You are the one who brought me here. You are
<br>the one who tells me lies about my father. You are the one you let us get capture by
<br>these-" She broke of. Be smart now, Malina thought. "By these people."
<br>"Ah, that what this is about. You are mistaken. You are not captives here. I simply
<br>wanted to talk and set new boundries. Rest assured, no harm will come to you."
<br>Malina's muscles relaxing, could he speak the truth? She saw no lie in his eyes but
<br>she wouldn't know how to look for them anyway. When she didn't say anything,
<br>Karman turned back to Dago again.
<br>"So, things are changing here. We cannot leave the woods so close to the edge
<br>anymore."
<br>"Some war going on here, eh? Or what's this about? There is enough land here. The
<br>woods are gigantic. Why settle here?"
<br>"We cannot speak to you about it and you will do good not to challenge me on this."
<br>"I understand", Dago said. "So no agreement anymore? This will kill me, you know?"
<br>"We allow you passage to these parts of the woods in exchange for trust and the
<br>goods we had declared before. But you will have to come alone from now on. We
<br>cannot allow more strangers to forage our territory."
<br>Walking away with their bodies unscathed Malina felt it to be a miracle she was still
<br>alive. Maybe stories and truth were further apart than she might have thought before.
<br>"You alright, Missy", Dago asked.
<br>"I should ask you this question. They were your men now lying dead in this misty
<br>forest."
<br>"Ah, the men. I almost forgot about the. There are plenty where they came from." He
<br>said it with no regret in his voice, no guilt. Or did Malina just not catch it right? "So
<br>you think I was lying about your father then?"
<br>"Obviously", she said. Her eyes glued to the path in front of them.
<br>"You should spend some more time with these people here. Would get your head right
<br>again, maybe."
<br>"How would I spend more time with them? They are dangerous savages. Eventhough
<br>they didn't hurt me right here doesn't mean they wouldn't do so in the future."
<br>"You are so narrow minded. Where do you think these people come from? They were
<br>all runaways someday and so will you. Trust me, Dago knows people."<br></p>
