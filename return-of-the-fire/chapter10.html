            <p>Chapter 9
<br>
<br>
<br>Asher was putting on his cold grey clothes over his underwear as the door flung open.
<br>"Blessed be the Enlightening for it is Him who has blessed us with his eye watching
<br>us from the-"
<br>"What are you doing, get out", Asher cried out and tried to hide his half naked body
<br>as best as he could.
<br>"Oh, apologies," An said with a big smile on his face, "I didn't know you were, ehm,
<br>occupied with something important this morning." He slowly walked back out the
<br>room, smiling and looking Asher up and down. His face red like his hair.
<br>"What is going on," Asher said to himself. The sun was shining through his window
<br>and painted the city in a bright white light. It looked even more enchanting than it had
<br>in the rain. The mountains were visible far, far away with the infamous Cloud Forest
<br>guarding it. A green carpet, which vanished behind the clouds. For a second Asher
<br>wondered what might await behind these mountains, but noone had ever managed to
<br>journey past them. The forest was deadly enough. Was there even something behind
<br>these mountains? He imagined going by boat around, but the mountains seem to
<br>stretch for ever, and the constant storms and rain made it hard to use ships.
<br>He dressed himself fully, red belt around his waist, hair tucked behind his ears and
<br>went out the the door. An was leaning on the opposite wall, that stupid and contagious
<br>smile on his face. Asher was unable to hold a grudge against him eventhough he saw
<br>him half naked just a moment ago. A smile starting to appear on his on face.
<br>"Well, finally. The sun is out for hours now and you were staying in bed? On a day
<br>like this?" They walked towards the dining room, always making sure there was
<br>enough space between them. Surely, it became almost natural for Asher. "Do you feel
<br>it?"
<br>"Feel what? The embarassment of you walking in on me changing?"
<br>"Ah that. Don't worry, you have nothing to feel embarassed about. You are in good
<br>shape my friend. I was talking about the sun. Can't you feel your whole body rejoice?
<br>Finally He has heard my prayers and banished the rain for a day or hopefully ever."
<br>"It wouldn't be right if the rain would stop for ever, don't you think?"
<br>"I think," An said with a serious tone, "it isn't right to torture all of humanity with this
<br>awful splatter. I know it's suppose to be a punishment for our sins, but why do we all
<br>have to suffer when only a few eggs are rotten?"
<br>"Good  question,"  Asher said.  "Why  are  you  so  immensly  happy  about  the  sun,
<br>though?"
<br>"Why is a man happy when he sees the love of his life walking towards him? Why
<br>does Hardulan love Siphone? It's how things are. I love the sun. You seem more a
<br>rain type of guy, aren't you?"
<br>"The sun is just a bit too bright for me. Rain is soothing and on those days you never
<br>crash into my room, so that's another point for it."
<br>They walked into the dining room, servants hussling around getting food for the
<br>younger Scorched. Asher had found out that they were held in rooms, alone. It was
<br>too dangerous for themselves and others to let them run around with others. An must
<br>have been through this too, how could he be so merry still?
<br>On their usual table Lilith, Patric and Kathrine were talking over their food. An and
<br>Asher got their own and joined the three.
<br>"So are we going tonight," Lilith whispered over to An. Not quiet enough at all.
<br>"Of course we do," he answered and turned towards Asher. "On sunny days, the
<br>guards around this place don't take their jobs all to seriously. So they go outside and
<br>play cards on some rocks or sitting on the walls, instead of right next to the door. So
<br>these are the days we can sneak out for one night."
<br>"Now I get it why you are so happy about it being sunny," Asher laughed.
<br>"Well," Patric said and spread some marmelade on his bread, "he also just really loves
<br>the sun. But I begin to love it too. His positive attitude is quite contagious. And who
<br>doesn't like being in a good mood for, even if it is just for a day, hm?" His eyes were
<br>underlined by a thick black line like always. He looked dashing.
<br>"Maybe it will even get you to smile a little bit more," Lilith said looking at Asher.
<br>"You weren't particularly helpful when I first came here," he responded and regretted
<br>it immediately. They were just starting to get closer, he didn't want to ruin that.
<br>A short moment of silence. "The past is in the past," An finally exclaimed. "We have
<br>to look forward. To tonight, for example. So Asher, are you coming with us or not?"
<br>"I don't know. I don't want to get into trouble. Sarina scares me a little."
<br>"And she is scary, trust me," Kathrine said, "but that shouldn't keep you from seeing
<br>something else than these boring walls for once. It'll be fun, I promise." Silently she
<br>slipped some bread and nuts into a satchel underneath her robe.
<br>"Alright, sure. When do we leave?" asked Asher.
<br>"When the sun vanishes behind the horizon," An said, "I will get you from your
<br>room. You probably want to be dressed before that."
<br>"What is that suppose to mean?", Lilith asked laughing.
<br>"Nothing", Asher said quickly, but An told the others all about it anyway. Leaving out
<br>no detail of what he had seen or what he hadn't but described anyway.
<br>The hallways were empty and Asher and the others made their way through the
<br>kitchen. At the back entrance, the one the cooks and servants used, they found no
<br>guards lurking behind the door. Normally there were three guards, armed with spears,
<br>looking after the entrance. Nobody could walk out or in without them noticing. Patric
<br>opened the door and scouted what was behind it. He gave the others a signal with his
<br>hand and they followed him with generous distance between each other out the door
<br>and into the courtyard.
<br>The three guards were sitting on some rocks under a big oak tree. Cards in their hands
<br>and money in front of them, they were absorbed in their game, but sat turned towards
<br>the exit from the courtyard. Patric kept close to the house wall and they sneaked away
<br>from the guards and the exit. Asher wondered where they would go from here. A wall
<br>of white quartz with spikes made out of the same material surrounded the complex.
<br>Were they suppose to climb over the wall? It wasn't too high but without giving each
<br>other some help to get up, Asher saw no way going over it. But the answer came
<br>soon. Patric stopped in front of a small maple tree. Like almost all maple trees it had
<br>low hanging branches, easy for climbing up. Patric was the first one, after him
<br>Kathine and Lilith followed. Asher in front of An. He grabbed hold of a branch and
<br>climb up, taking good care of where he put his feet. It reminded him of Elyas. On
<br>sunny days they would climb on trees hanging over one of the bigger rivers in Yevum
<br>and jump down into the water from there.
<br>Asher jumped down outside the walls, that had surrounded him every day since he set
<br>foot into the white city. The air was warm and dry, the sun a gleaming hot fire on the
<br>horizon to the west.
<br>"We have to stop by the river first," Kathrine said.
<br>"Do we have to every time?" asked Lilith. "They wouldn't mind if you don't come,
<br>you know?"
<br>"But we are going anyway," said Patric.
<br>"What are we doing exactly?" Asher wanted to know. It began to be a bit cryptic
<br>amongst these people again.
<br>"We will meet Kathrine's pets first," Lilith said, obviously not amused by the thought.
<br>The way down to the river was short. Through a few winding alleys with huge white
<br>quartz buildings on either side they walked downhill. It was the carpentry district and
<br>Asher felt instantly at home. The smell of fresh cut wood and oils, the sounds of saw
<br>chewing throught wood and little saw dust dancing in the air. Work was dying down,
<br>it was late already, but a few had still some work to do.
<br>"Weren't you a carpenter, too?" An asked.
<br>"Yes, I was. But I was doing more carving than actual carpentry work. I don't even
<br>know if I ever build a closet myself. But I would do the ornaments on the side and
<br>trims for people."
<br>After another curve the river was visible. The rushing and gurgling sound grew
<br>louder and louder. The river span a good hundred metres or so. Asher had never seen
<br>a river of this size. It was magnificient but scary at the same time. How much power
<br>was behind that mass of water. With the rain it would be even wider. On both sides of
<br>the river, the ground was still wet with a few puddles of water sprinkled about. These
<br>were the zones the river would conquer when the rain came back.
<br>Kathrine rushed off towards an asortment of trees, a couple of dozen maybe not more.
<br>She pulled out the pouch from under her robe and crouched down, empying the
<br>pouch on the ground.
<br>"What kind of pet is it she is having?" asked Asher again. He saw nothing between
<br>the trees.
<br>"They don't always come out to play, so you might miss them today, but they are
<br>racoons," An said. Lilith was glancing over the river to the other side of the city,
<br>apparently not interested the least bit.
<br>"Don't make fun of it," Patric said and looked him straight in the eyes. "She adores
<br>the little creatures and I don't want you to upset her."
<br>"I would never have made fun of her, believe me. I think it's kind of cute." Asher
<br>looked back to Kathrine still crouching on the ground and making weird high pitched
<br>noises. But apparently, they worked because a little family of three racoons slowly
<br>advanced from the trees. One was smaller than the other two. Their little striped tails
<br>flayling throught the air.
<br>Kathrine immediately began to spread out her hand with some food in her fingers.
<br>"Come here," she shouted over her shoulder, "but be slow about it. Don't scare them
<br>away."
<br>"You go ahead, I have seen them often enough," An said and stayed behind with
<br>Lilith. Patric already walking towards Kathrine. When the two boys got closer they
<br>slowed down and squatted down. Karthrine put the piece of bread close to her feat
<br>and the racoon snatched it from there. He looked adorable while eating this tiny piece
<br>of bread.
<br>"Here take these." Kathrine threw a piece of bread towards Asher, he wanted to tell
<br>her she could have  just given him the bread like a normal person, but then he
<br>remembered. They weren't normal. He felt a sting in his heart.
<br>The smaller one sneaked towards Asher's extended hands. "Asher," Kathrine shouted
<br>and scared of the little racoon, "don't let them eat from your hands. They don't know
<br>what you are." Her eyes stared angrily at him.
<br>"Apologies. I wasn't thinking about that." He lowered his piece of bread to the ground
<br>and the little racoon advanced forward again. Tiny paws extended towards the food
<br>with sharp claws on every toe. The creature handled the bread with so much care
<br>Asher couldn't help but smile about the little guy.
<br>"See, he understands why I like them," Kathrine said. "That smile says everything."
<br>"Well, these guys are adorable."
<br>After the racoons ate all that Kathrine had brought them, they got back to An and
<br>Lilith who stopped talking as they saw them getting closer.
<br>"What are you two talking about?" Asher asked.
<br>"Lilith wanted some more detailed information about," he looked Asher up and down
<br>again. "And I was happy to dwelve back in that memory, that's all."
<br>"I have this burning desire to hit you right now," Lilith said and waved her fist.
<br>"Lucky me. If you could hit me, my beautiful smile would have to do without all my
<br>teeth. Now, who would want to look at that?"
<br>"Right," Patric said, "let's go? I am getting thirsty."
<br>Entering the bar the air smelled of beer and some kind of unidentifyable stew. People
<br>took a look at Asher and the other's red belt around their waist and made room for
<br>them. It was a full house but a group of old men quickly left their table in the far
<br>corner of the bar. Vile glances were exchanged between them. The white quartz was
<br>dirty and full of dark soot. A couple of dark wooden tables with more beer and food
<br>stains on them like anything else Asher had ever seen in his life. Why did they
<br>wanted to go in this bar?
<br>"Just a question, but why did we not go into a bar, which is a little, well, nicer?"
<br>"Is this not good enough for the great Asher of Yevum?" Lilith smiled. "We can leave
<br>and find a proper place for your lordship if necessary."
<br>"I wasn't-"
<br>"My lord it was all my fault," An said. "I beg of you, don't punish me too hard for my
<br>mistakes. My arse is already sore from the last beating you gave me. It hurts when I
<br>sit." Kathrine and Patric chuckled.
<br>"Alright, I get it."
<br>"Do you?" Lilith asked.
<br>"Come on guys, let him in peace." Kathrine's voice was as always so clear and soft
<br>for his ears. "You might not know this, but the best singer of all of Asta performs in
<br>this bar on sunny nights."
<br>"Yes, we come for the singing," An said but his face was telling a different story. "It's
<br>all about that beautiful voice."
<br>"I need to get me a paddle or something so I can slap you sometime," Lilith said.
<br>"Come on, let's get some drinks. Asher you drinking tonight or not?"
<br>Asher politely declined and Lilith left with An in tow. Even for going out Lilith didn't
<br>bother to comb her hair at all. It was a mess.
<br>"Hey Asher," Kathrine said and he turned towards her, "have you heard a lot of
<br>romantic tales in your life?"
<br>"I think I have heard the most well known once or twice, but they are not the stories I
<br>like most, if I am being honest." This conversation took a turn for the worse.
<br>Kathrine and Patric exchanged glances. "I, I mean we both, often wonder if the tales
<br>are true at all. They describe kissing your love like something, well, magical. Is it
<br>anything like that?"
<br>Asher had been trying to keep the memories and thoughts about Ameline as far away
<br>from  his  consciousness  as  possible,  but  Kathrine  seemed  to  love  every  word
<br>regarding his experiences. Ameline's face flashed for a second in front of Asher, her
<br>face without the burn, her beautiful smile.
<br>"You know how it is," he finally said. "A lot of these stories is about exaggeration,
<br>but there is truth at the core." He quickly added, "It's nice, but it's not as magical as
<br>the stories might make you believe it is."
<br>Kathrine wanted to jump on that statement, but saw Lilith come towards their table
<br>and she bit her lips instead. An had two big clay mugs in his two hands and Lilith was
<br>balancing three. They crashed down on the table with a loud noise, Lilith smiled as if
<br>she was proud of herself for making it this far without breaking one of the mugs.
<br>"So we have to best of the best here," she exclaimed. "Rasborrow brew for the four of
<br>us and then another alcohol free apple juice. They say it's the best in all of Asta, but I
<br>wouldn't be so sure of it. I didn't see any quality label on it like on the Raspborrow's."
<br>For a moment Asher hesitated. The others seemed alright with drinking alcohol. They
<br>never got mad at each other, he never had seen them throw fists at each other and he
<br>had seen them drink quite a lot in Lilith's room a couple of times. Doubt remained
<br>inside of him. The image of his drunk father crashing through the front door, him and
<br>his brother climbing out a window at the back and running off. But he wouldn't be
<br>like his father. He was a different man. Maybe it wasn't the alcohols fault after all,
<br>and the man was broken instead.
<br>"I just wanted to say, I admire you Asher," Patric said and cut through the thoughts. "I
<br>like you standing up to your beliefs and standards. You won't get undermined by the
<br>group pressure at all. I think that's commendable."
<br>"Thank you ver much. I try my best."
<br>"Will you give up your beer then as well?" Lilith asked.
<br>"You wish." He groped the mug and swung it into the air. A bit of fluid escaping the
<br>edges. "Let's toast my friends. To Asher and his strong morals."
<br>"To Asher," the others cried in answer. Asher kept silent and his cheeks began to
<br>burn. He never had heard his name in a toast. And Patric calling everybody his
<br>friends made him feel warm to his stomach in a way alcohol never could.
<br>The conversation topics swayed from making fun of people they know like Saratsu to
<br>more serious topics like the inevitable war that was around the next corner. An and
<br>Lilith went to get another round, the apple juice surprisingly good for this nasty bar.
<br>After that the others became more and more drunk, their laughs became louder, the
<br>sentences more incoherent and their words slurred. Asher, again, felt out of place next
<br>to his drunk friends. He was the only one not in on the jokes again. Jokes, which can
<br>only be funny when you a drunk from the strongest beer in existence, Rasborrow
<br>brew.
<br>"Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys," An cried out. He was facing the bar counter and saw
<br>it first. Asher right next to him would have seen to but wasn't sure what he was
<br>seeing. "They start soon. Asher you don't want to miss this." He giggled again. His
<br>breath smelled of beer which made Asher hold his breath for a second and look the
<br>other way. On the counter in front of him, behind other groups of people sitting
<br>around their tables, a group of four climbed up the counter.
<br>Side by side, two women in the middle, one men on either side. The women were
<br>dressed in traditional outfits for higher ladies, wife's of Lords and Highlords. Their
<br>dresses were identical to the last seam. Fiery red base with black overlays. The legs
<br>underneath  covered  by  a  white,  tight  pant,  that  was  visible  because  they  were
<br>standing right up. Their necks covered by black fabric, their hair voluminous locks of
<br>brown  hair.  The  men  clothed  like  clerics.  Around  their  necks  the  sign  of  the
<br>Enlightening,  a  golden  sun.  On  their  heads  they  wore  simple  grey  caps,  which
<br>revealed no hair underneath. No beards, clean shaven and clothed in light yellow
<br>colors. The colors of the church.
<br>The croud was cheering and roaring for the squad, Lilith and An must have been the
<br>loudest in the whole bar, but even Patric seemed to enjoy himself and whistle with his
<br>fingers in his mouth.
<br>Then they began to sing. The men in deep bass while the woman sang with high
<br>soprano voices. The text, nothing Asher had ever heard before, but the folk in front of
<br>the bar knew the words by heart, even after drinking a mug of beer too much. The
<br>two men raised their arms to their hats and threw them off over their shoulders behind
<br>the counter. Underneath their long hair broke free from their prison and flowed down
<br>beneath their shoulders. The women grabbed needles, which held their hair up, and
<br>with swift movement they removed them from their hair.
<br>With this new found freedom of hair, they began to dance, turn and jump on the
<br>counter, the bar folk raging with encouragment, some even trying to pick at the
<br>womens dresses. They got a hard boot on their fingers or even faces, but it didn't kill
<br>their mood, it hightened it.
<br>"Man, you are in for a treat," An shouted over the noise to Asher. "Nothing is like the
<br>first time, I tell you."
<br>And then Asher finally understood why they were here. Why the bar was dirty and in
<br>one of the ugliest parts of Asta, but the tables all filled to the last seat. Some didn't
<br>even have a place to sit. It was all for this show. Asher's cheeks began to burn and his
<br>pants felt tighter as the two women removed their dressed from their bodies. A sound
<br>of  ripping  fabric  and  the  fiery  red  dresses  were  gone.  Underneath  the  white
<br>underpants and a white bra with more fabric to cover the neck. In all his life Asher
<br>had never seen the neck of a grown women in the flesh. He had seen breasts for
<br>feeding the children and even some other parts people weren't suppose to see, but the
<br>neck was something everybody made sure was covered under all circumstances. Were
<br>they going to remove that piece of clothing too.
<br>While Asher's eyes were fixed on the women, he didn't see how the men go undressed
<br>but  they  were  only  covered  by  tight  underpants  and  their  necklace  of  the
<br>Enlightening. The foor climbed down, still singing their song of which Asher didn't
<br>understand the words anymore. It was too loud. In front of the counter, for chairs
<br>stood with two men and two women on them. Asher hadn't realised before but they
<br>seemed to be part of the show.
<br>An leaned in closer to Asher, "I wish we could be there too someday. It costs a
<br>fortune, but I think it would be worth it."
<br>Asher glanced over to Lilith, whose cheeks were red and she seemed sweaty. Actually
<br>Asher was sweating himself. Maybe because of the full house or maybe because of
<br>the women ripping off their bras and underpants, dancing naked in front of the two
<br>lucky men on their chairs. Hands were  slapped when they wanted to touch the
<br>performers, but they got close. Very close. One of the men, a middle aged blond guy
<br>was leaning back and shouting something to his buddies. He seemed to enjoy himself.
<br>The singing didn't stop, neither did the dancing, but it looked like it was building to
<br>something.  The  crowd  got  quieter  and  quieter,  so  at  one  point  only  the  four
<br>performers were singing, softly now. No words actually, just humming a melody, so
<br>foreign to Asher it seemed like from another world.
<br>And then then they went quiet. The two men and women standing in front of their
<br>partners on their chairs. The women crouching down a bit so they were face to face
<br>with the men sitting on their chairs and the men walking closer. The air was electric,
<br>so many people holding their breath. The people on their chairs moved their hands to
<br>last clothing on the respective performers, and with a strong ripping sound they tore
<br>off the clothing, exposing the men's penises and the women's necks. The crowd
<br>roared like an explosion in Asher's ears. An, Lilith and even Kathrine and Patric
<br>jumped up from their seats and raised their mugs in the air. Asher stumbled to do the
<br>same. Everybody was on their feet continuing the song from before, the four naked
<br>people dancing on their respective partners. It was the first time Asher saw the neck
<br>of a grown woman who was not his mother. What a scandalous sight. People were
<br>stoned for showing this in public but here everybody seemed to enjoy the show of
<br>naked skin.
<br>"It's getting tight in your pants, isn't it?" Lilith asked Asher.
<br>He was too embarassed to admit, but it was true. Lilith's eyes locked with his own.
<br>There it was again. The desire he felt so often with Ameline, who seemed a distant
<br>memory by now. A person from another life.
<br>"I told it's good," An laughed and Asher freed himself from Lilith's eyes.
<br>"It is something," he said. "It is definitely something."
<br>The night was still young and Ocreis and Acreis, the two moon brothers, shining from
<br>the skies without a cloud to disrupt their silvery light. Both half full, the one was
<br>leaving and the other coming to his full potential. Asher was the only one walking
<br>straight when they made their way back to the complex and into their beds. Lilith and
<br>An were leading the group with Asher trying to keep up. Patric and Kathrine lacked
<br>behind.
<br>"Asher," An cried out, "is there something you would want to do in this beautiful
<br>night. It's still young, as are we."
<br>He thought it over for a second, actually considering what to answer. There was
<br>something that has been nagging him all day. "Well there is something," he finally
<br>said, "but I don't think it would be a good idea at all."
<br>"You know you can't touch these women from back there," Lilith giggled. "I don't
<br>even know if they would want to touch you even without these red hair."
<br>"Very sweet of you, Lilith."
<br>"Oh come on," An slurred. "What is it you would want to do? Tell us. We don't have
<br>to do it, we just want to know, right?"
<br>Lilith agreed. "Alright," Asher said, "I am a bit suspicious about cleric Saratsu. He
<br>was suppose to write my family and he got a letter back from them, but what he read
<br>me from there didn't sound like the truth at all. It's just a feeeling, I don't know why I
<br>even think that. Why would he lie to me, right?"
<br>"Right," Lilith said. "Well, it is probably nothing, but why not be sure of it?"
<br>"What do you want to say with that? Even if I got the letter in my own hands, I can't
<br>read it. Can you?"
<br>"No, nobody of us was taught to read, a great shame it is. There are suppose to be
<br>books on Scorched and their abilities from the old times, but the church holds them
<br>tightly in their hands. But that doesn't mean we can't find someone who can read us
<br>what is really written in the letter, does it?"
<br>"Can't agree more, my dear," An said. "So are we gonna do that, or not?"
<br>"You mean break into the room and snatch the letter? How would we even know the
<br>letter is mine and not some list of random words. I definitely can't tell them apart at
<br>all."
<br>"Well, newby," Lilith said, "all letters have a wax symbol on them. It tells you from
<br>where they are from. So we simply need to look at the broken symbol and find your's.
<br>What does it look like? From where do you come from anyway again?"
<br>"I am from Yevum, south east from here, so you know. That might actually work. It's
<br>a simply symbol, it's an axe crossed with a saw and the sun as it backrgound. We are
<br>a lumber town."
<br>"Highly  interesting,  I  might  say,"  An  said  and  his  eyes  glistened  in  the  dim
<br>moonlight. "So we sneak into the classroom and snatch that letter from his desk."
<br>"And then we get the letter to another cleric, someone who doesn't know anything.
<br>They can't all be lying, right? So you can get some answers, Asher."
<br>"Alright, very good plan, for some drunk children," Asher said jokingly.
<br>"Is he mocking us?" An asked. "We, who are willing to make his vision come to life?
<br>Not very nice of you."
<br>"But  how  would  we  get  into  the  room  anyways?"  Asher  asked  and  avoided  to
<br>comment. "Are you guys any good at lockpicking? I sure don't know a thing."
<br>"Lucky you," Lilith said, "that I have a key myself to the room."
<br>"A key?" Asher asked suspiciously. "How and why would you have a key to the
<br>Saratsu's teaching room?"
<br>"Anybody ever tell you it's not polite to ask so many questions?"
<br>"Alright, let's not fight," An said. "We go in quickly, get the letter and we are out
<br>before anybody sees anything. Isn't that a marvelous plan? I love sunny days, the
<br>world is full of possibilites."
<br>The complex was quiet and looked forsaken. The night guards were out now, their
<br>shift had changed. The street was barely visible even with the light from the moons,
<br>but first clouds were already forming up and keeping the light from touching the
<br>ground.
<br>"So how are we going to get in now?" he asked. "We can't climb back up the tree, can
<br>we?"
<br>"We walk through the front door like normal people," Lilith said without a giggle.
<br>She seemed serious.
<br>"But wouldn't they know that we were out and not in our rooms," Asher said.
<br>"He is so naive sometimes," An said. "Sarina is no idiot. She knows she can't keep us
<br>locked up forever. We made a deal years ago, that when the sun shines true, we are
<br>allowed to leave the complex. So we do it, mostly at night."
<br>"If we were allowed to leave, why would we sneak out in the first place?"
<br>"Well," Lilith said, "not everybody agreed with it, especially Lord Amberic. He is
<br>under the impression we are too valuable to lose our heads in a street brawl or
<br>something. Lucky for us we don't live in a smaller town, there people are sometimes
<br>quite direct with their hate for us. But here we are under the protection of the
<br>Highlord himself. Nobody will touch us, Sarina knows, we know it, the people know.
<br>Apparently you didn't, which is hilarious how slow you are."
<br>"Quite slow indeed," An added.
<br>"So," Lilith continued, "we sneak out on sunny days, so Lord Amberic doesn't notice
<br>it. Only a few guards would go over Sarina's head, but there are some. But the front
<br>door is guarded by a very loyal duo. Two splendid looking young men. They will not
<br>ask questions and tell noone. So stop worrying and let's get back, I am feeling tired."
<br>The two men at the front door, opened without a word of question. Lilith, An and
<br>Asher snucked through followed by Patric and Kathrine, who excused themselves
<br>and went straight for their rooms. Or for the same room. Asher pitied them a bit. He
<br>could taste their affection for each other on his lips.
<br>The hallways were empty and dark, but Lilith grabbed a torch, which hung at the
<br>entrance and played with the flames. They seemed to burn brighter when she held
<br>them. Her hand careassing the flames with her soft hands.
<br>"Do you need to get the key from your room?" Asher asked Lilith, but she only
<br>laughed at him.
<br>"Hold this and watch," she said. The torch lost some of its brightness when it changed
<br>its holder. Lilith crouched down and looked at the lock at the door. It was a lock made
<br>of iron, something Asher had never the luxury of seing before coming to Asta. Back
<br>in Yevum locks were made out of wodden contraptions, which worked more out of
<br>brute force.
<br>The lock began to shine with a bright yellow light, little flames licking at the wodded
<br>door, but without making a mark on them. The flames seemed to have their own
<br>mind. They were moving together, like someone told them too.
<br>"What are-" Asher couldn't finish, because the door opened up without much of a
<br>sound at all. Liquid metal dropping down to the ground, the flames vanishing swiftly.
<br>"Are you crazy?" Asher asked. "They will know it was us who broke in here."
<br>"No," Lilith said, "they will know it was me. And I will handle it don't worry. I have
<br>been here much longer than you have. It's no problem at all. Now find your letter and
<br>let's be out of here."
<br>Asher walked into the room, the torch spending him light. The letter was in the first
<br>drawer underneath some paper with other wax symbols on them or none at all. He
<br>grabbed it and they were out.<br></p>
