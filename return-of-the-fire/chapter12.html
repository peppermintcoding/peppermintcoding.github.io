            <p>Chapter 11
<br>
<br>
<br>A knock on the door made Asher jump up from his bed, he told the outsider to come
<br>in, half expecting it to be An as almost every morning. This time it wasn't the smiling
<br>young  man,  it  was  a  serious  and  concerned  looking  Sarina  stepping  over  the
<br>threshold. Her tied up on top into a knot, arms resting on either side. She seemed
<br>tense.
<br>"Good morning, Asher," she said and Asher told her to come in. "I am sorry to bother
<br>you so early but something has happened that needs discussing in private I fear."
<br>The first thought Asher's mind let him think, was his mother. Another letter had come
<br>from Yevum and Sarina was breaking the sad news. Or was it because of the letter
<br>Lilith, An and he stole from Saratsu? Would he be in trouble now eventhough Lilith
<br>promised to take care of it somehow? Or was it something with his brother? He felt
<br>guilty for not thinking of him earlier and more these last few weeks.
<br>"It's about Patric and Kathrine," she said and looked Asher straight in the eyes.
<br>"What happened?"
<br>"It appears, Patric and Kathrine ran away last night. We are inclined to think, he
<br>wanted to return home with her. It pains me to see, they have lost their trust in me and
<br>Lord Amberic to care and protect them. Or maybe the reason is unrelated to that, we
<br>don't know. I simply wanted to come in here and tell you in person."
<br>"What does that mean now?"
<br>"It means we have doubled the guards outside and inside the complex. I didn't want it
<br>this way but apparently I have no choice in the matter anymore. The order comes
<br>from the Highlord himself."
<br>"So it means I can't leave here anymore?" Asher was baffled. It never felt like a
<br>prison here, but it surely looked like one if he thought about it. But they never
<br>explicitly forbid them to leave. Where would they go anyway?
<br>"It does, yes. Tell me, are you considering leaving us and going back where you came
<br>from?"
<br>"I think I would be the last person to leave, I can't go back home. It would mean
<br>certain death most likely. You don't have to worry about me."
<br>"So I should worry about someone else, then?"
<br>"Oh no, you don't. Well, I don't know for sure, but I don't believe Lilith or An would
<br>leave on their own will."
<br>"We are not concerned with Lilith, but Anderius might be foolish enough to go. But
<br>we can't have it in these times. Preparations for the war have already begun and it's
<br>time for you to show your value to the Highlord and Lord Amberic."
<br>"The war has already began?" Did that mean Asher had to go into battle now, caring
<br>for the injured like he was taught? He wasn't ready yet. He could barely stitch up
<br>someone with these clunky tools.
<br>"It hasn't, but at this point it is inevitable. Highlord Rember will declare war in a
<br>weeks time and you will be going with the troops, just like An will." Sarina paused
<br>for a moment looking around the room. "Lilith will stay behind, don't worry she will
<br>be fine."
<br>"What will happen to Kathrine and Patric?" he asked again.
<br>"We will send people after them trying to persuade them to come back, but that is not
<br>your concern right now. I simply came here to inform you in person, I thought it was
<br>the proper way, given you became quite close with them."
<br>"Thank you," Asher said and  Sarina left  the  room without another word.  Asher
<br>followed her out the door, after she vanished behind the next corner.
<br>An and Lilith were already sitting in the dining room, their faces grim and sad. An's
<br>eyes looked reddish and Lilith looked like she hadn't slept the whole night.
<br>"What's up with you two?" Asher asked. The two shot him confused glances. "I guess
<br>Sarina came to you, too, to talk about Kathrine and Patric. I never thought they would
<br>run away, to be honest with you."
<br>"Please, can you shut your rainin' mouth about it. You seem to be blind to everything
<br>like always." For a moment Asher didn't believe, these words came from An's mouth.
<br>After all  this time,  Lilith could have said these  words,  but  An too? Apparently
<br>something was going on again, and he was the only one who wasn't in on the secret.
<br>"Then please enlighten me," he said.
<br>Silence. An stood up from his seat and left. Lilith watching him go and Asher sat
<br>there clueless.
<br>"Don't take it to personally," Lilith said.
<br>"It just sounds like I am at fault here. I didn't make them run away."
<br>"Maybe not, maybe yes. But still, it's just another reminder, that we will never get
<br>what we want in our lives. An especially."
<br>"What do you mean by that? I don't understand. Was he in love with Kathrine, too?"
<br>"Not quite, but it's not important." She pushed some bread and cheese over to Asher,
<br>who tried to eat some, his stomach feeling tense.
<br>"Let me ask you something," Lilith began again. "Why do you think the two ran
<br>away?"
<br>"I guess they wanted to run away together, so they could be together. Oh wait, that
<br>doesn't really make any sense does it."
<br>"No it doesn't."
<br>Asher thought for a second. "So they didn't run away after all?"
<br>Lilith simply shook her head, looking at him. Her eyes teared up and she brushed
<br>them away with her sleeve.
<br>"So what did really happen?" Asher asked.
<br>"It's simple, really. It's an age old story I guess. Two people in love you can't be in
<br>love.  Hardulan  and  Siphone  came  from  different  worlds,  socially.  So  she  killed
<br>herself with a dagger through her hurting heart after they executed Hardulan. Or
<br>sometimes it is war who takes away. Or in our case, the curse will never let us have
<br>something  even  remotely  similiar  to  a  physical  relationship.  So  they  did  the
<br>inevitable."
<br>"How do you know? Maybe they really ran away."
<br>"Why do you cling to a different explanation so desperatly?"
<br>Asher bit a small piece from his bread and chewed slowly. It didn't taste good. "I kind
<br>of feel like it was my fault. I told them how it is to kiss someone. I told them about
<br>Ameline. Don't you think it had something to do with this? Isn't that why An is angry
<br>with me?"
<br>"He is angry because he is angry. You were just the person he lashed out against,
<br>because you talked like it was any other day, when two of our friends died yesterday.
<br>We heard it from one of the guards, Raegar, he told us on our way to breakfast. Not
<br>that we needed confirmation of something we both knew."
<br>"So you already knew?"
<br>"Kathrine came to me last night, after we snatched that letter of yours. She was quite
<br>out of it, I thought I had her convinced to stay and sleep on it, but apparently she
<br>couldn't anymore. I mean who can fault them. They have been too close to each other
<br>for years now. It is a miracle they lasted as long as they did."
<br>"I see," Asher said. The thoughts circling in his mind. "I need to go and apologize to
<br>An."
<br>"Wait," Lilith said, "give him some space for now. I think he really needs that at the
<br>moment."
<br>They sat in silence and ate a few bites. Asher was the first one to break the silence
<br>again, "Why would Sarina tell me they ran away? Why lie?"
<br>"Good question. The lie is not for you though, it's for Lord Amberic. He would
<br>change a lot around here, when he finds out two of his little toys died because of too
<br>much body contact. Sarina put in some good words with him, so at least the older
<br>ones of us, don't have to live in lonely prison rooms without any human interaction.
<br>So she tells everybody the story how they ran away, and that it won't happen again,
<br>because the guards have been doubled. So I also guess it is good bye for our nightly
<br>bar trips, then. It's quite a shame."
<br>"Why do you seem so calm about it?"
<br>"Anger can be dangerous. Maybe not for An, maybe not for you. But for people with
<br>power, they are easy to abuse it when angry or guided by their feelings. I can't give
<br>into them. Horrible things can happen, and I won't let them."
<br>Asher chewed the last of his slice of bread, drank a bit of water. He wanted to ask her
<br>what she meant with horrible things, and if they had already happen once or twice.
<br>But he didn't dare.
<br>"You didn't seem to concealed your emotions, when I first got here. I remember quite
<br>vividly, you being furious at me sometimes."
<br>"Ah, right. Well, you made it quite hard to not be angry at you. I am no stone statue
<br>after all, but a human like everybody else. Even if they sometimes forget. But let's
<br>talk about something else. I don't want to keep thinking about this all the time. I have
<br>an idea for your letter."
<br>"Alright, what is it? Do you know a cleric or something too?"
<br>"No, not quite. But I know someone, who knows a cleric well enough to ask him
<br>something like this. You remember the guard Raegar, I told you about him. He knows
<br>someone and agreed to get the letter to them."
<br>"And he will do that because he is a good man?" Asher was sceptical.
<br>"What do you think he would want from me? I don't actually have anything to offer,
<br>not even my body if I wanted to. So yes, he is just a good person. Oddly enough."
<br>Asher wasn't sure if he believed her, but it was the only option he could see. They
<br>finished their breakfast and went to Asher's room to get the letter and give it to
<br>Raegar before his shift was over.
<br>Asher was waiting anxiously behind the main entrance door. The heavy wood doors
<br>would open any second now. He was walking up and down like a cat ready to
<br>pounce. Lilith was leaning against a pillar, she seemed relaxed.
<br>"Can you stop that already," she said. "You will make me nervous with that, too."
<br>"I didn't know, you could even be nervous at all. You always seem quite relaxed and
<br>confident to me, if I am being honest. How would my anxiety change anything about
<br>that?"
<br>"It has it's perks to know you could burn anyone alive, who might try to overstep
<br>their boundries. And I also have nothing to lose in a sense, so why worry at all? It's
<br>not like they could do anything to me, right?"
<br>"What about them banishing you from here? Where would you live? How? Doesn't
<br>that scare you a bit?"
<br>Lilith hesitated, put her weight on her other foot and said, "First of all, they won't
<br>trow me out of here. There has to be something big to get Lord Amber to abandon
<br>this whole project. But on the slight off chance it would happen, I would simply not
<br>do anything. I am not afraid of dying."
<br>"I whish I was a little more like you," Asher said with respect in his voice. "You
<br>should lend me some of that confidence of yours sometime."
<br>Before Lilith could answer the door opened without a creak and four guards came
<br>rushing in, Raegar the last of them. Lilith gave Asher a quick smile and they let the
<br>guards through. All armed with swords on their sides and spears in their hands. For a
<br>moment Asher wondered what would happen if he were to attack one of them. Were
<br>they instructed to kill him, or where they instructed to knock him out without serious
<br>danger to his life? He didn't want to find out though.
<br>"And," Lilith asked Raegar when the others were out of range, her voice a soft
<br>whisper.
<br>Raegar leaned in to her and Asher, handed back the letter to Asher and spoke, "Well
<br>most of it is accurate of your cleric here, but my man told me something quite
<br>interesting."
<br>"Spill it, quickly," Asher said. He was still wanting to walk up and down. Standing
<br>still didn't feel right.
<br>"At the bottom of the letter, the last sentence doesn't make any sense. My cleric told
<br>me, it means 'Caution to the reader of this letter, do not take note of this sentence'. I
<br>don't know what that means, but it sounds like a hidden message, doesn't it."
<br>Asher thought for a moment. This didn't make any sense. The hidden message was
<br>his brother talking about his work not something like this. This didn't mean anything.
<br>"I don't know," he said after a while.
<br>"Well, I think it is safe to say you were right in some way about Saratsu lying. He
<br>didn't share this with you so it must mean something, right?"
<br>Raegar cleared his throat, "My cleric said something else, too. Sometimes, clerics
<br>hide messages in letters, because they are the only one's who can read them. Well,
<br>apart from the upper class maybe, but still. So I think this has to mean something. It
<br>is even directly addressed to the reader, so I don't know, but something is strange
<br>about this, I tell you. I have to go though, I will get into trouble if I don't hurry up.
<br>Lilith." He bowed slightly to her and quickly went away. Asher shouted a "Thank
<br>you", after him, but he didn't turn around again.
<br>"What was that about?" Asher asked.
<br>"What?"
<br>"He literally bowed to you a little. How do you get him to do something for you and
<br>then he shows even more respect to you? What does he get out of this?"
<br>"Like I said already, he doesn't get anything out of it, so leave it Asher. Focus more
<br>on the letter. There is something foul going on here. Do you know what it might
<br>mean?"
<br>Asher was completely clueless. It might be a hidden meaning in there, but he didn't
<br>know why or what it meant. He didn't talk with Ogerius about anyhting therelike. He
<br>knew about the hidden meaning behind Elyas's work, but nothing else was discussed.
<br>"Apologies, but I have to go now, Asher," Lilith said. "My break is over and they are
<br>expecting me back. We can talk more about it later. At An's at sundown?"
<br>"Sure, I will be there, if he doesn't kick me out before."
<br>"Talk to him. Everything is just fine, I promise." And she was off, the sound of her
<br>boots getting quieter and quieter with every step she took. The quartz building did its
<br>best to conserve the sound and let it bounce from wall to wall, but at the end, the
<br>sound vanished completely and Asher was alone.
<br>Asher waited in front of An's door for half an eternity, unable to knock on the heavy
<br>oak  door.  He  passed  some  time  with  examining  the  craftsmanship  of  the  door.
<br>Nothing special, plain wood planks interlocked with each other without the help of
<br>any metal in them. It was like most doors.
<br>He knocked, twice and waited. No answer from inside. A big part of Asher had hoped
<br>Lilith would be there already and he didn't have to face An alone, but it didn't look
<br>that way.
<br>Still no answer. Asher opened the door slowly, not sure what he was expecting. An
<br>was sitting on the ground, with his back against his bed, exactly where Asher and
<br>Kathrine had sat the first day they all met up.
<br>"Come in," An said. "Don't be shy now."
<br>"How are you doing?"
<br>"Well, how am I doing? Not great, but not so bad anymore I guess. The anger made
<br>room for a deep sadness. I don't feel the energy to even anger myself. My body
<br>doesn't seem to be able to do that anymore."
<br>"Can I sit?"
<br>"Sure." An made some more room between them and Asher sat down with his back
<br>against the bed. Something was strange though. Not only didn't Asher see any alcohol
<br>bottle or clay mugs, he neither smelled the alcohol.
<br>"I am a bit surprised. Isn't it normally especially these times when people drink the
<br>most."
<br>"And that's precisely why I am not doing it. I don't like to drink when I am sad. It
<br>doesn't really help, you know? Well, you don't probably but I am telling you now.
<br>When you are sad, sometimes you just have to be sad for a bit without trying to
<br>escape the pain. It will catch up with you anyway."
<br>"I guess so. Have you heard, we will be moving tomorrow?"
<br>"Yes, I have heard. Lucky them, I suppose. They did it just in time to not have to
<br>experience another war. Sometimes I feel like people are only fighting with each
<br>other, because that's just what you do when you are a Highlord. They have too much
<br>time and wealth to think about some stupid way to throw away human lives."
<br>"My father used to say the exact same thing. Lucky for him, they rather wanted him
<br>to make siege equipment and other things than to go to war as a undertrained soldier.
<br>But still, war always means some of your friends and family will die. It always
<br>happens."
<br>The two sat in silence. Lilith still didn't show, she must have been held up by
<br>something, the sun vanishing behind the horizon.
<br>"You know what I can't get out of my head?" Asher asked.
<br>"What?"
<br>"I am concerned what will happen to that racoon family, Kathrine was feeding all this
<br>time. I actually wanted to go down there and give them something myself, but now
<br>that the guards have been doubled I don't know if that is a good or even possible
<br>idea."
<br>"Those rainin' creatures," An laughed. "That's what you are concerned with right
<br>now?" He laughed full heartidly. "You know, Kathrine and me, we never really
<br>worked together, because, well, because stuff, you know. But I already miss her, the
<br>day she is gone. Isn't that weird? How she didn't seem important when she was here,
<br>but now that she is gone it matters so much to me?"
<br>"I honestly miss her voice the most."
<br>"Like sweet, sweet rum. So smooth and clear."
<br>"I don't know about the alcohol, but I think I agree."
<br>"So your father gets really bad when he is drunk? What exactly does that mean?"
<br>Asher stared blank at the wall in front of him. The little fireplace, half in the wall,
<br>looked forsaken and lonely. Memories bubbled up from the deepest prison Asher had
<br>build for them. So many memories. Even the good ones, he didn't want to think
<br>about. They were all with the same person and Asher didn't want to think about this
<br>person at all. "It means he did bad things to all of us, even when he wasn't drunk. But
<br>with time and more beer it got worse and worse. Once he broke my arm and told
<br>everybody I fell from a tree playing. The worst thing about it was, how he told the
<br>story. Everybody heard the story, at least twice because he couldn't keep his mouth
<br>shut about it. He made the story funny, I mean not for us, but for everybody else who
<br>listened. And after all that, even when he sobered up enough, he never said sorry. Or
<br>that he was doing something wrong. Or anything. He never talked about it." Asher's
<br>eyes as dry as a fire fixed on the fireplace. He was done losing tears because of his
<br>father.
<br>"That's messed up," An said. The door swung open without a notice and Lilith came
<br>into the room. Her hair messy and she was sweating. She held her boots in her left
<br>hand, walking around only in her socks.
<br>"Apologies," she said and closed the door, "it took longer than I thought today, but
<br>now I am done for today. What are you guys talking about?"
<br>"Asher is vastly concerned with the well being of our little racoon family here. I think
<br>we need to find a way to sneak out sometime and give them some food or he will try
<br>something stupid himself."
<br>"I never understood why Kathrine liked them and fed them," Lilith said and she sat
<br>down on the oposite side of Asher and An, her back resting next to the fireplace. "I
<br>would have  never  guessed from her appearance, she would  care  for those little
<br>creatures."
<br>"Well, you shouldn't judge someone entirely by their appearance, or we would never
<br>have hung out with Asher." An laughed and Lilith with him.
<br>"Alright, very nice," Asher said. "I like you too."
<br>"Very sweet. So what were you two up to today?" An asked, his smile almost honest.
<br>"We were investigating the stolen letter," Lilith said and built up logs of wood in the
<br>fire place. "And we actually found something interesting. Tell him, Asher." She
<br>ignited the fire with a swift hand movement. It started licking at the logs quickly and
<br>a big wave of embers flew up the chimney.
<br>"Yes, the last sentence on that letter was questionable," Asher said with his eyes fixed
<br>on Lilith in front of the fire. Her hair melted with the fire in the background into one
<br>waving red. "It basically told the reader to ignore this sentence completely. But why
<br>write it down only to explain not to read it. I don't get it. Half of me believes the
<br>cleric of Raegar lied as well, but that doesn't seem very likely, does it?"
<br>"No, not at all," Lilith said. "He had no reason to lie and why would he make
<br>something like this up. I think there is something your cleric from Yevum is hiding
<br>from you. But why write something so cryptically."
<br>"That's the big question," Asher said and the room fell silent. The fire crackled in the
<br>fireplace and the air was getting warmer inside the room. An stood up and opened a
<br>window to let some fresh air in.
<br>After a while of silence Asher said, "I have to get home and find out what it is all
<br>about. Maybe that's what is means."
<br>"But," Lilith said, "why write in this way, when the purpose of it was to not get read
<br>to you anyway. It doesn't make sense. And you can't get back to Yevum. They would
<br>never let you do that."
<br>"I mean, there is always a way," An said and looked from Lilith to Asher and back to
<br>Lilith. "You have never planned to run away for real. Not even fantasized about it?"
<br>"No I haven't," said Lilith and looked to the ground. Something was wrong. Asher
<br>couldn't shake the feeling, she was withholding something from them.
<br>"I have," An said without noticing what was wrong with Lilith. "Often actually, to
<br>keep me busy on those rainin' days, when it pours without end."
<br>"So what would you suggest," Asher asked.
<br>"If you want to know so badly, I will share some of my secret ideas with you, my
<br>friend. Not all of them are actually possible, but there is something I always felt
<br>would be an easy out."
<br>"What is it?" asked Lilith seemingly interested now, but her eyes looked sad.
<br>"Lucky for you, Asher, the Enlightening has heard your prayers and given you the last
<br>and vital part to my plan of leaving this all behind and sit next to a fire somewhere
<br>else with hopefully a good drink and some sun in my eyes. Tomorrow, we will go to
<br>war and some of us might never come back from there alive."
<br>Asher felt cold, goosebumps appearing all over his arms and legs.<br></p>
