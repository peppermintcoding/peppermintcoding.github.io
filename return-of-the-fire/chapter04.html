            <p>Chapter 3
<br>
<br>
<br>The white buildings towering over Asher shone in the faint sunlight. The white
<br>quartz, of which most of the buildings in Asta were made, was wet from the rain and
<br>gave the buildings an even more otherworldly appearance. Asher had never before
<br>seen buildings out of giant stones, stacked on top of each other. In Yevum, most
<br>buildings were either made from clay, cob, which was a mixture of clay, sand and
<br>straw or simply wood. The whole trip through the white city, his mouth was as wide
<br>open as his eyes were.
<br>He journeyed for weeks with seven clerics making their way from Yevum to Asta.
<br>The clerics ignored Asher for the most part and kept their distance out of fear. But
<br>inside their faces he saw not only fear but pity. Eventhough the clerics believed it to
<br>be a curse from the Enlightening cast upon people as severe punishment, a few
<br>couldn't help themselves from feeling sorry. Ogerius, the cleric administering his
<br>mothers medicine and giving Asher counsil, made sure he could escape from Yevum
<br>with his brothers and sisters.
<br>The whole way Asher could only think about his mother, brother and Ameline. He
<br>had to  leave  in a  rush, cleric  Ogerius helping him escape  from  the angry  mob
<br>gathering in the small town of Yevum. He only could imagine what Ameline's and her
<br>family were feeling. Eventhough, most of his thoughts were with his brother, who
<br>would now be the one trying to take care of their ill mother and dealing with John.
<br>His inbability to hug Elyas one last time or squeeze his mothers hand were weighing
<br>hard on him. But this was part of the curse, or whatever it was, touching another
<br>human would burn their skin to the bone and further.
<br>"That's it", cleric Farita proclaimed. "I wish you the best of luck and", he hesitated,
<br>"the blessing of the Enlightening." Farita was one of the few who spoke with Asher
<br>over the course of their voyage. He was the only one seeing him off to his new home.
<br>"Thanks", Asher said. "Thanks for everything." He held out his hand to shake Farita's
<br>for a goodbye only to realize, that he couldn't. Farita nodded to him and went towards
<br>the giant cathedral of Asta.
<br>Three knocks on the big oak door. The building complex was part of the palace of
<br>Highlord Rember. It was said to be the only place in all of the lands where Scorched
<br>were welcome and could live without fear of retribution from the common folk. Most
<br>Scorched did not survive long enough to even get here, but he did.
<br>The door opened, a young man, maybe about Asher's age with a red handbead
<br>holding his flaming hair away from his face.  The  broad  smile  on his face  was
<br>contagious. He wore cold grey garments, a simple long sleeve shirt and tight pants. A
<br>red belt was holding up the pants.
<br>"Welcome friend", he said with a deep voice, "to the most magical place in all of the
<br>world. Let your heart be at ease, as for here you are finally safe."
<br>"Greetings", Asher said offering his hand again before remembering.
<br>"Oh Elightening", the young man jumped back. "Be careful with this around here.
<br>Are you an assassin hired to end my life or do you like living on a knives edge. But
<br>come in the weather is terrible as always."
<br>"Sorry, I forgot. I am new to this. I am Asher by the way." He entered the building
<br>and was greeted by a small entrance hall with pillars along the side and statues of old
<br>heroes, lords and ladies along the walls.
<br>The young man's face confused, "I am Anderius. But everyone calls me An with a
<br>long 'a'. You say you are new to this. You mean the whole red hair thing? How long?"
<br>How long had it been? The smell and cries of Ameline still replaying in his head.
<br>How many nights has it been where he cried himself to sleep? "Three weeks I think.
<br>How long since you have changed?"
<br>"Three weeks?", An said trying to contain himself. "You are not joking with me here?
<br>I wouldn't mind if you do, but please don't." Asher nodded unsure what to make of
<br>this. "I don't know if I should laugh about it or envy you. But you will learn about this
<br>duality soon enough. Let's go, I show you around."
<br>Asher followed him out of the entrance hall through a short corridor into a little
<br>garden area. White pillars holding up the roof above the walkways so they were safe
<br>from the rain. It was building a perfect square with some smaller trees in the middle
<br>with benches made entirely out of white quartz. Asher had never seen a building with
<br>so little wood construction in them. It seemed they didn't use any wood at all to build.
<br>Only white shining quartz.
<br>"This is for when this hideous rain finally stopps. Here we can be free of the people
<br>stares and whispers."
<br>"You are not so fond of the rain are you?", Asher asked.
<br>"Oh it's that obvious? Well, for my part the only curse upon these people isn't our,
<br>well our talent, but this rain. Why else would the Enlightening send us these clouds if
<br>not to rid himself of us. To cover his eye of the human filth?"
<br>"Why does he give us sunny days then, if he hates us so much?" Another hallway
<br>with bare walls lead them further into the buiding complex.
<br>"Maybe he hasn't given up on us completely and wants to see if we have changed at
<br>all. Either that or he might be mighty forgetful."
<br>"You must be popular with the clerics I presume?"
<br>"Oh Newby, I am popular with everybody. Who wouldn't love me? You'll see." That
<br>smile was so genuine and full of life, it reminded him of Ameline. His heart sunk
<br>down his knees, the smile on his face froze. She would never be able to smile like
<br>that anymore. An didn't notice but lead him further into another room, which looked
<br>like a dining room for about forty people. How many Scorched were here? And why
<br>haven't they met any other?
<br>"This is where we eat", An continue his tour. "The cook is amazing. His will let
<br>anything else taste like ash to you." Bread. Elyas. His little brother alone at home
<br>without him.
<br>"Hey, you look a bit sad here", An said. "It'll all be fine, you'll see. Lord Amberic is
<br>taking good care of his little project here."
<br>"I thought this was part of Highlord Rember's palace."
<br>"Well yeah, it is. But gathering all of us here was Lord Amberic's idea. You will meet
<br>him soon enough. But let's get you to your room. You must be exhausted and in dire
<br>need of a shower." An laughed at Asher's reddening face. It had been some time since
<br>he washed himself with real soap.
<br>After a few right and left turns and more of An's talk about the cook and Lord
<br>Amberic they finally arrived at his new room. The whole time An left a generous
<br>amount of space between the two. Asher had to always remind himself not to get too
<br>close, but An seemed to be doing it out of habit.
<br>"So this is it", An said. "I know nothing fancy or anything but depending from where
<br>you come it might be bigger than you thought." It was way bigger. Back at home, he
<br>had to share a tiny room with his brother. Enough space for two beds and a furniture
<br>to harbour their clothes.
<br>"I will come pick you up tomorrow morning for breakfast and introduce you to
<br>everybody, or at least a few people. But you will see. Ah before I forget, the shower is
<br>just down the corridor. Soap should be somewhere in here. Okay? Great, see you then
<br>Newby."
<br>"Thanks, until then", Asher replied. A giant closet made from dark wood was on the
<br>right side of the room. It was beautifully made but without many ornaments. The bed
<br>on the other side of the room was actually made from feathers instead of straw. When
<br>Asher lied down he felt like he was floating, so soft. Exhaustion washing over him,
<br>he felt the weeks travelling in his legs and body. He needed sleep. So he took of his
<br>clothes lay down and tried to sleep. And for the first time in weeks, exhaustion won
<br>the battle against his guilt and he just fell asleep.
<br>"There are some ground rules everyone needs to follow without any compromises
<br>here", An said while they were walking down the hallway towards the dining room
<br>for breakfast. "First of all, keep your distance. We all would like to hug and cuddle up
<br>in this kind of weather but we can't. We don't want any infernos burning the place
<br>down, alright?"
<br>"Infernos?", Asher asked  with one  brow  up. Quite  the  exaggerating for burning
<br>someone's flesh off.
<br>"So I presume there aren't many travellars coming through your little hut village?"
<br>"Well, clerics come and go sometimes. We have quite the large monastery but that's
<br>about it. They don't talk about news with the commoners." It was weird to talk with
<br>someone standing so far away from each other.
<br>"A true newby, aren't you?. Scorched touching any other living being, makes a big
<br>burn",  An  explained.  Asher  knew  all  to  well  about  this  interaction.  Amleline.
<br>"Scorched touching Scorched.. well they turn to a pile of ashes with a big inferno of
<br>fire. Nice to look at, even nice to stand near but be one of the two parties doing the
<br>touching, not so good. Understand?"
<br>Asher nodded. "Splendid. That's actually all the rules but I will give you a little tip.
<br>Don't talk much about your past with the others. You are in quite the unique position
<br>and some would be offened by it."
<br>Rustling of ceramic came from the dining room, soft chatter and the smell of fresh
<br>bread, tea and other things Asher didn't know.
<br>"You keep to me and all will be fine." There was that smile again, making Asher relax
<br>a bit. His muscles were sore form travelling but tense at the same time. His stomach
<br>growled like a giant cat.
<br>The dining room flooded with red hair. Almost everybody had them. From small
<br>children to adults sitting on the dark wood tables eating their meals. A generous
<br>amount of space between them. For the smaller children there were some servants,
<br>clothed in white with wodden rods at their waist, making sure they stayed away form
<br>each other and ate their meals. Everyone wearing the cold blue clothing Asher had
<br>put on himself. He found it lying in the big closet in his room. Red belts around the
<br>waist.
<br>An guided him towards the counter were all sort of food was presented. Asher picked
<br>up some tea with sugar, which was a special treat in his family. Sugar was rare. The
<br>sugarcane only growing in specific conditions. Then there was bread in different
<br>brown hues, smelling delicious. Butter, marmelade and some meat and cheese were
<br>offered as well. Asher picked some of everything feeling his stomach tightening.
<br>"Leave something for the rest of us", An complained.
<br>With rose cheeks Asher was about to put some of his stuff back, "It was a joke,
<br>Newby. Man."
<br>They hurried towards some bigger table with three other young people sitting there.
<br>The table was in a simple dark brown, just like the others, no ornaments, not even
<br>down the table legs. It was weird being surrounded by this magnificent white quartz
<br>all around with statues and round pillars, but the wood furniture was as simple as it
<br>could be. The three people all had fiery red hair.
<br>"Good morning my people, this is the Newby I told you about, Asher." The three
<br>stared at him with vile glances. Why were they so angry looking? Did he do anything
<br>to offend them?
<br>"Morning", Asher mumbled sitting down quickly trying to avoid their faces.
<br>"So this is Lilith." An pointed towards one of the women, or were they still girls?
<br>Asher couldn't tell their age. They seemed around the adolescent age, but they could
<br>also be five years older than Asher himself. Her hair was shorter than Asher's and it
<br>was a red mess. It looked like she didn't bother looking into the mirror in the morning
<br>and brushing her hair into place. It even looked like she hadn't done for several days.
<br>Her  eyes  a  warm  brown  eventhough  her  expression  was  filled  with  anger  and
<br>resentment. Her nose was small.
<br>"She is nicer when you get to know her more. Come on Lilith, be nice to him. He just
<br>arrived. It's hard on him, alright?"
<br>"Oh no the poor boy just arrived. I am sure everything must be very hard on him."
<br>"Well", An said diplomatically, "the other two are Patric and Kathrine." The two
<br>looked like from stories Asher heard about when he was younger. Like Hardulan and
<br>Siphone, or how he imagined the two, just the red hair was not how he imagined
<br>them. Their faces were flawless with a mystic to them to draw in your eyes. Patric
<br>with shoulder long hair and Kathrine with hair reaching down beneath the table
<br>where Asher couldn't see. Patric had black lines under his eyes as it was custom for
<br>men from the upper class. On Kathrine's covered neck she wore a red lether band
<br>with a tiny heart made of iron hanging down.
<br>Asher began to cover his bread with some marmelade. He felt the glances of the
<br>others on his. He began to sweat, his feeling of hunger receding.
<br>"How was your journey here? Where are you from?", Patric asked. A bit of a smile,
<br>forced for sure but still there, creeping up on his face.
<br>"I come from Yevum", Asher said. "It took me a few weeks coming here, eventhough
<br>I don't quite know why I am here. What are we suppose to do here?"
<br>The three exchanged glances. "Lord Amberic", An said, "is training us. For whatever
<br>purpose he and the Highlord feel fit for us. Eventhough we are to this day still quite
<br>useless if I may say it out loud. And you won't change a thing I am afraid."
<br>"Why do you keep saying that? What's so special about me?"
<br>And then they laughed. For a moment the tense atmosphere disappeared and they
<br>laughed. Not all genuienly.
<br>"They all think they are special when they come here", Lilith said.
<br>"Well none will beat you my dear. Our grand jewel, the bringer of fire, the-"
<br>"Cut it out An, or else."
<br>"You are not special", Kathrin said. Her voice soft as feathers and soothing like the
<br>rain. "We all are Scorched, special to the common folk and maybe even compared to
<br>the lords and Highlords of this world. But the thing that divides our group, is the time
<br>of awakening." Time of awakening. The time he changed.
<br>"And you with your three weeks are the least special of us all", Lilith spat. "I would
<br>be surprised if you could light a dry piece of tinder." He could burn of someones face,
<br>but touching anything else did do nothing at all? What was she talking about?
<br>"I wouldn't know how to go about it in the first place", Asher said. Trying to bite a
<br>piece of bread. His apetite gone with the conversation. His stomach still growling.
<br>"Why are you being so mean about it anyway? Aren't we all going throught he same
<br>rainin' shit? Aren't we all the same cursed ones, so why go after me like that?" Lilith
<br>was beginning to get on his nerves.
<br>"Going through the same? You can't even begin to understad any of our pain." Her
<br>eyes glaring at Asher. She stood up without another word and leaft the dining room.
<br>Couldn't  understand  pain?  He  had  his fair  share  of  pain  even  before  this curse
<br>happened.
<br>"Don't think too much about it", An said, trying to smile but failing for the first time.
<br>"Tell me, Asher", Kathrin asked, "it's been a few weeks since you awoke is that
<br>right?"
<br>Asher nodded. "Did you kiss someone before you awoke?", she asked again.
<br>"Yes, her name is Ameline." Ameline. Her face. The smell, her cries, her fathers fury.
<br>"Even on the mouth", she asked. Her face stiff and emotionless.
<br>"A couple of times, yes. When we were alone we did it eventhough it's frowned upon
<br>to do so before marriage." But he couldn't finish his sentence, Kathrin rose up and ran
<br>out of the dining room. Patric right on her heels trying to catch up.
<br>"Did I say something wrong?", Asher asked.
<br>"Told you not to talk about your past", An said. "It doesn't bode well here. Finish your
<br>breakfast, we need to get going. Cleric Saratsu doesn't like it when we are late. He
<br>enjoys punishment with the rod."<br></p>
