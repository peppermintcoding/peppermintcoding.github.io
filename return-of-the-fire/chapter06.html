            <p>Chapter 5
<br>
<br>
<br>Asher stood before Lord Amberic, who was dressed in a fancy blue coat with golden
<br>buttons and white pants. Beside him stood an old woman who introduces herself as
<br>the headmistress Sarina of this so calIed school. In front of Asher was a table with an
<br>unlit torch on top of it.
<br>"I hope you you've had a warm welcome", Sarina said. "I am sorry I couldn't be there
<br>when you arrived but I had important matters to attend to. An did is job, I presume?"
<br>"Yes he did", Asher said.
<br>"Let's not drag this on for much longer", Lord Amberic interrupted. His voice loud
<br>and deep. "We have called you here to assess your skills, your talents if you want.
<br>You awoke three weeks ago I heard?"
<br>"That is correct, mylord."
<br>"Tell me, how did it happen?"
<br>"How did what happen, mylord?" Was he talking about Ameline? Did they know?
<br>"Ah, my mistake. Do you know why you changed?"
<br>"No, mylord."
<br>"After quite some time of research we found out, to become a Scorched you had to
<br>almost die. That's what all of you had in common. Some drowned, some almost died
<br>of rainfever, some fell and so on. So what is your story?"
<br>"I think I drowned. I fell into the river and was fished out. Must have been close
<br>then."
<br>"I see", Lord Amberic said with obvious interest. "So, let's get to the exciting part. We
<br>will want to know how strong the gift is in you. Please light that torch in front of
<br>you?"
<br>"Mylord, I don't know how I could. I tried before in cleric Saratsu's class, but I
<br>couldn't do. I wouldn't know how."
<br>"He is too new to this, mylord", Sarina said. Her voice was soft and warm. "I told you
<br>it would be a waste of time. He has awoken to late."
<br>"Apologies, but what does that mean? Nobody around here seems to give me any
<br>straight answer. Why is it so important when I awoke. My touch is death to others
<br>just as theirs is."
<br>"Well you are right, that all Scorched burn other living beings", Sarina began. "The
<br>key difference is the power of their gift. The later it is you awake the weaker you are
<br>with the flames. Scorched who awoke before they could remember have far greater
<br>power than, well, people like you. To be frank we never had one latebloomer like
<br>you."
<br>So that was the big thing everybody was tiptoeing around. He was the weakest. Even
<br>weaker than the children he saw in the dining room before.
<br>"Does that mean you won't keep me here?" He couldn't get back to Yevum. He
<br>couldn't look Ameline in the eyes ever again.
<br>"All Scorched", said Lord Amberic, "are welcome here. I make no difference. We will
<br>find a way for you to be useful. The clerics will teach you medical procedures and
<br>other things alike so you can help on the battlefield."
<br>"I understand", Asher said. The battlefield? How was he supposed to help people if he
<br>was unable to touch them without severe burning?
<br>"You shouldn't miss any more of your class. You are dismissed."
<br>Asher turned around and left the room. He felt their glances burning in his back.
<br>Back in cleric Saratsu's class, the short men with dark brown hair, pointed towards a
<br>table with An. On the table, a simple birch wood table, lay a giant pig on its back. A
<br>tray with fine metal tools, some already shining with blood red some not used yet. An
<br>was standing over the fat pig, making a long cut on its stomach.
<br>"What the hell are we to do?", Asher asked.
<br>"Practicing. They don't want us practicing on real people so they got us these." His
<br>hands moving swiftly about. He obviously had some practice in this already. The
<br>cleric was trying to help Patric and Kathrine out with their pig.
<br>"Where is Lilith?"
<br>"Miss her already", An grinned. "Have you already fallen for our princess? Wait,
<br>don't tell her I called her that. She hates it. She basically hates everything but that's
<br>beside the point."
<br>"You haven't answer my question yet." An was taking a needle and thread from the
<br>tray, holding the needle with wodden pincers.
<br>"Oh have I not? My apologies. Lilith is not like us others. If our talent was to kill, we
<br>would be blind without arms and she would be an Onkari. What I want to say is, she
<br>doesn't compare to us. While we are learning to stich people up and use our hands to
<br>burn off wounds, she is training to conquer kingdoms."
<br>"But the Onkari are only a myth and this is real. What can she do?"
<br>"So first of all, give me another thread, this one ripped again." Asher picked up some
<br>of the thread and holding it for An to take, who raised an eyebrow. Asher quickly lay
<br>the thread close to him, remembering to keep his distance. "Secondly the Onkari are
<br>not a myth. Or how do you want to explain Highlord Karzan's death just a few
<br>decades ago? He was surrounded by his guards during the full moon, but an Onkari
<br>appear right in his own shadow, slitting his throat and vanishing without a trace.
<br>Without noise. You come from a  small village, of course you don't know what
<br>happens in the world."
<br>"Right. I see this is a touchy subject. But what about Lilith?"
<br>"A little tip, don't get caught up with her. Greet her in the halls if you see her, say
<br>good morning during breakfast but don't let it go too far. You only get burned."
<br>Quickly he added, "Emotionally."
<br>The rest of the lesson An was trying to teach Asher how to stich a wound without
<br>touching the patient, or in this case the pig. They inflicted more and more wounds for
<br>them to practice on, and Asher's practiced, steady hands were quick to learn the new
<br>movements. At the end of the lesson his needle danced over the pig's skin, in and out,
<br>closing the wound.
<br>"Well done", Saratsu praised. "We are done for today."
<br>While the others were leaving the room quickly, Asher stayed behind.
<br>"Can I talk to you, cleric?", he asked.
<br>"Of course, of course. What's troubling you?"
<br>"I wish to write a letter to my family back home. I wish to know how they are. Could
<br>you record some words for me, to send to them. If we send the letter to the monastery
<br>in Yevum I know they will make it get to my family."
<br>"It can be arranged. What would you like me to write to them." Saratsu picked some
<br>paper from his desk and dipped the green feather into dark ink. He wrote fast and
<br>Asher felt it hard to find the words. He didn't know what to say but wanted to know
<br>how they were doing. Know how his brother was keeping up and if mother was doing
<br>better or worse. Fear crept into his chest, making it harder to breathe. Should he write
<br>something to Ameline? No. It wouldn't make a difference. Not anymore.
<br>"You know what," Asher said, "I think I will sleep about and we can discuss what I
<br>want to write to them another day."
<br>"Alright, as you say. You know where to find me." Asher stood up and left the room
<br>of the medic teacher.
<br>Walking around the corner of the hallway towards his room. The door was open, not
<br>like he left it. Slowly opening the door, he saw An lying on his bed, shoes on the side
<br>staring at the ceiling.
<br>"Finally", he said. "What took you so long?"
<br>"What are you doin in my room, An?"
<br>A big smile appearing on An's face, making it hard for Asher not to smile himself.
<br>How does he do it, Asher thought.
<br>"I am here to help of course, like I have been doing all this time, you see. Sarina has
<br>given me this vital role of showing you around and all, but also to teach you what you
<br>will need. Nobody of them knows what it's like to be Scorched. But we do. So what
<br>do you say, let's burn some stuff?"
<br>"I can't", Asher said with disappointment. "I can't even light a candle. I tried it all the
<br>way from Yevum to Asta. Nothing."
<br>"Don't worry. I am a good teacher." He sat up on the bed, putting his shoes back on.
<br>"If we fail, we can ask Lilith, maybe she'll help. We all learned from her actually."
<br>"And from whom does she learn all this from?"
<br>"She doesn't", An said walking past him out the door. "Come on, it'll be fun. You'll
<br>see."
<br>Asher debated for a second to stay in his room, but what was he supposed to do?
<br>Everybody either looked at him as a child or hated him. And being alone with his
<br>memories and worries wouldn't be nice neither. An was after all the only one being
<br>friendly to him. Why was that?
<br>The two young men walked towards the square enveloped garden area. White quartz
<br>surrounding them, with little bits of rain falling on the lush green in the middle. The
<br>garden was slopen a bit, so the water could run to one side and flow further through
<br>pipes to the nearest river to avoid flooding.
<br>"Well, I would have liked some sunshine but who are we to ask the Enlightening for
<br>anything, right?" An fished some dry cinder out of his pocket as well as some pieces
<br>of wood.
<br>"So, first of all I will show you how it should look and then you try, right?"
<br>"I don't think it is that simple", Asher said.
<br>"Everything is that simple at the end. It only looks complicated when you don't know
<br>it. For me it is like using my arms to lift something. Just another part of my body
<br>doing the lifting. Here, watch." Held out one of the pieces of wood with his left hand,
<br>his right hand touching the further end of the piece. Within a second flames danced
<br>through his fingers, without leaving a trace on his hand. He lifted his hand, smiling at
<br>Asher with the whitest teeth.
<br>He threw the burning piece of wood into the rain and after a few more seconds the
<br>flames vanished with white and black smoke.
<br>"If you ever get Lilith to do this, her piece will keep on burning for hours in the rain
<br>if it has enough wood. Quite something she is. But now it's your turn." She handed
<br>pieces of cinder over to Asher. He held a bubble of cinder in his hands trying to, do
<br>what? He didn't know how to begin.
<br>"What am I suppose to do now?", he asked.
<br>"You need to find the flame within you. It might be tiny for you but it should still be
<br>there. It is in all of us, burning hot. Find the fire and then guide it to the cinder."
<br>Find the flame within you. Asher closed his eyes, thinking it would be the right thing
<br>to do. Searching through his body in hope to find it somewhere. What he found was
<br>something else. He found memories and images of what had been and what could be.
<br>He saw his mother lying on her bed, bones breaking through her skin. Saw his father
<br>angry and drunk with only Elyas to take the hit. There was no flame within him.
<br>"I can't", Asher said.
<br>"Keep trying."
<br>"Why should I", Asher opened his eyes. "You said it yourself. Even if I find the flame
<br>it will be tiny. I won't be able to do anything. I am useless like this. Why keep trying
<br>when it obviously doesn't work."
<br>"Because", An said, no smile on his face, "either you try harder or you will die. Even
<br>in your little town you know the next war is coming. It is as certain as the rain. It
<br>either raining or it's about to rain. We are either at war or close to it. They will look
<br>after  Lilith  trying  to  make  her  into  a  weapon  they  can  use.  But  we?  We  are
<br>expandable.  Only  good  to  heat  up  the  metal  tools used  to  heal  soldiers on  the
<br>battlefield. If you can't even do that." He broke off, looking down.
<br>War was always coming, An was right.
<br>"Alright", Asher said after a pause. "I will keep trying." He looked inside of him,
<br>searched for it, for the tiny flame he knew must be inside somewhere. He felt the cold
<br>stone on which he sat, heard the soft rain falling. Where was the flame hiding? His
<br>mind racing from one part of his body to the next. Was it maybe too small to find it?
<br>And then without any warning the cinder in his hands began to come alight. Small
<br>yellow  and  red  waves  of  fire  licking  at  his  hands.  Their  touches  warm  and
<br>demanding.
<br>"I did it", Asher cried out. An was looking over his shoulder, almost angry.
<br>A slow clapping in Asher's back. "Well done, Newby." Lilith chuckled. The flames in
<br>his hand dying down. All what's left was dark grey ash picked up by the wind and
<br>fleeing from Lilith. It wasn't him afterall. The triumph in his belly vanishing.
<br>"Well I guess it was a long day for all of us", said An. "Let's try another time maybe
<br>without interruption. You will get hang of it eventually trust me." He glanced over to
<br>Lilith, who shrugged and walked away. Her frizzy hair uncombed, wild like a storm.
<br>With the setting sun, darkness swallowed Asta, the white city. From Asher's room
<br>higher up than most other buildings he had a grand view of a huge chunk of the city.
<br>Lanters were being lit all around and people would lay their work down for the day.
<br>Asher missed working with his wood terribly during his journey. He didn't take any
<br>of the tools with him, because they weren't his. Everybody owned the tools. Iron was
<br>too precious and expensive to be owned by a lonely worker. All he smuggled with
<br>him was a single knife, sheathed in black leather. A wet stone for sharpening and oil
<br>against rust were tucked in a small satchel. He would need to find some good wood
<br>tomorrow to carve and work. He missed the calming work routine.
<br>A knock on his door startled him, he slid the satchel with his precious knife under his
<br>bed and walked to the door.
<br>"An, what are you doing here?"
<br>"I am happy to see you too", An said. His smile as wide as his face, his words a little
<br>slurred. Was he drunk? "We have been thinking, well mostly I did the thinking as
<br>always, but don't tell them I said that. They are all a little simple in the head, if you
<br>know what I am saying." He chuckled. "Anyway I came here to invite you to our
<br>nightly get to together. Just the five of us now." With one hand he was holding
<br>himself up at the door frame, the other hand on his hip. He was drunk. Asher could
<br>tell.
<br>"I don't know. The other ones don't seem to like me at all. So why would I want and
<br>spend the evening with them."
<br>"Good point", An still smiling. "But you miss the crucial argument, we have liquor.
<br>Good one at that. I will show you, now come and don't be like that always."
<br>"Like what."
<br>"You know, all sad and thoughtful. You live too much in your head, Newby. Sorry.
<br>You'll see it's nice to loosen up a bit from time to time. Tomorrow morning you can
<br>be all sad and thoughtful again."
<br>"I don't drink", Asher said. He promised himself to never touch a bottle. Not with
<br>what his father had become. An's eyes widening, his mouth gasping as if Asher said
<br>something unheard of.
<br>"Did you try some before? This is not some cheap stuff, you should know. It's
<br>stronger than Rasborrow beer, but taste like cherry. It's reeeeeally good."
<br>"It's not the taste or anything. I just don't like drinking that's all."
<br>"Alright, alright, alright." An's eyes staring into nothing like he was thinking about
<br>something vital. "Well, you can come anyway, though. I would pull you with me if I
<br>could, but you know the whole burning up in flames is not my style. So just come
<br>with me."
<br>What was the alternative? Sitting in his empty room, alone with his thoughts and
<br>fears. He had nothing to keep his mind occupied. How bad could it be going with
<br>him? He other's didn't look like they liked him anyway, so what was there to lose?
<br>"Alright, I come with you. But I won't drink."
<br>"Sure", An slurred. "No need to. It will probably get you some points with the others.
<br>More for us, you know."
<br>An's room was along the hallway and around the corner. He was swaying a bit from
<br>left to right, which was dangerous, one stumble and he would crash into Asher. He
<br>tried to put more distance between each other, without success. Without knocking An
<br>opened the door. Asher heard glimpses of laughter but it died immediatly when they
<br>saw him standing in the door. The smell of alcohol in the thick air. Lilith with a bottle
<br>of red liquid sitting near the small fire place on the ground, legs crossed. Patric and
<br>Kathrine sitting with their backs to the bed, also on the ground. A couple of candles
<br>standing on the bedside table. All eyes were on Asher. He couldn't see their faces, so
<br>he wasn't sure if they were angry to see him or not. A big book shelf, made out of
<br>white birch, was standing beside An's bed, filled to the brim with books bound in
<br>leather. A painting hanging over the fireplace, but the light was to dim to make out
<br>what it was about.
<br>"I am back, and see who I found", An said pointing towards the awkwardly standing
<br>Asher.
<br>"I see you brought something with you from the toilet", Lilith said. The others
<br>chuckling. It washed the half hearted smile from Asher's lips.
<br>"Very funny, but no. Come on five him a chance. It's not every day we get someone
<br>new close to our age. He is one of us now." The others silently looking at An and
<br>Asher.
<br>Kathrin vanquished the silence. "You right, Anderius. Come on and sit with us over
<br>here." She pointed to her left, Patric sitting to her right.
<br>"Thanks", Asher said. Not sure what to say at this moment. Lilith following him
<br>walking throught the room with her eyes.
<br>"Here", Lilith passed him the half empty bottle. For a moment he wasn't so sure
<br>anymore. His conviction began to falter. One drink wouldn't do him any harm. It
<br>would probably be good for him. Loosening up a little after all this, being part of the
<br>group. He took the bottle. The glass was warm from were Lilith held it. Should he
<br>try?
<br>"He doesn't drink. Pass it down to me will you? I am feeling thirsty already again."
<br>Thankful for An taking the decision away from him, he passed the bottle down to
<br>Kathrine.
<br>"Why don't you want a drink", Patric asked. A simple question with so many answers.
<br>The others waiting patiently for him to talk. Even Lilith didn't comment on it. An
<br>sipping on the bottle.
<br>"My father often drinks a beer to much. So I swore myself not to touch any drink."
<br>Patric was nodding knowingly. He looked down at his hands. Could he understand
<br>Asher? For the first time since he arrived here, he didn't consider the others having
<br>just as bad a life as he had. So much pain waiting behind their angry and hostile
<br>faces. Maybe even hiding behind An's cantagious smile.
<br>"That sucks", Patric said.
<br>"It does."
<br>"Well", Kathrine began, "I want to apologize for earlier in the dining room. I didn't,
<br>it's just hard."
<br>"What's hard? What is it I am doing wrong all the time?" The question lingered on his
<br>lips the whole day. Finally shared with the world, the vacuum it left behind almost
<br>swallowing him whole.
<br>"We all awoke when we were children, too small to even remember in most cases."
<br>Kathrine's voice was soft and she didn't seem as drunk as An. "We don't remember
<br>touching our parents at all, feeling their warmth on our skin. Playing on their laps,
<br>playing with other children. Nothing. You on the other hand, had an almost full life to
<br>live before it was taken from you. You felt lips on yours because you could act on
<br>your feelings. Do you not see how that might be upsetting to us?"
<br>"It doesn't mean my life was perfect though."
<br>"I am not saying it was perfect. You sure had your problems, your father apparently
<br>being one of them. But at least you had a life. We didn't. Not a normal one."
<br>"But why do you hate me for it so much? I can't do anything about it. I didn't ask for
<br>this anymore than you did."
<br>"They are not angry with you", Lilith said. Behind her small flames playing with her
<br>shadow. "They envy you. What do you think Cathrine and Patric would give to spend
<br>a night together without the impossibility to touch each other. What would they give
<br>to kiss like you have? Everything."
<br>The others silent, only the fire crackling.
<br>"What about you then?", Asher asked. Feeling anger rising inside of him. "You don't
<br>seem to see yourself with the others. Why do you hate me so?"
<br>"Because", her voice rising, "you disgust me. Coming in here with these sad little
<br>puppy eyes. What pain did you endure in your life, tell me? It doesn't even compare
<br>to ours. You can't even imagine it. So stop feeling sorry for yourself. If anyone should
<br>walk these halls with their head down it shouldn't be you."
<br>"And how do you know all that? You don't know a thing about me." Asher voice
<br>sounding agitated. Anger and frustration bubbling inside his stomach, aching to be
<br>released.
<br>"I don't need to know your life", Lilith hissed between her teeth.
<br>"Why not? Because yours was so much harder? How would you even begin to
<br>quantify pain. Your suffering doesn't discard mine. I have felt enough pain in my
<br>life." Asher needed to stand up. He was shouting the words now. "I believe you had
<br>your fair share of pain. But this is not a rainin' competition. Stop making it into one."
<br>With  that  he  stormed  out  the  room,  he  heard  An  say  something  but  he  didn't
<br>understand. He ran. As far and fast as he could.<br></p>
